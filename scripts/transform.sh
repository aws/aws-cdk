# it needs (e.g., jsii-rosetta) for the build.
#
# The reason Yarn doesn't find the executables in the first place is that they are
# not dependencies of each individual package -- nor should they be. They can't be
# found in the lerna workspace, either, since it only includes the individual
# packages. For potential alternatives to try out in the future, see
# https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-ops/issues/1636
