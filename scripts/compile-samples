# A wee little script to compile samples in a package directory.
#
# Normally, samples are only compiled when doing 'pack.sh', if you are iterating
# on them you can use this script for quicker feedback.
#
# This could maybe have been an 'npm run' script, but it's not self-contained
# (needs the "decdk" package to compile against and runs jsii-rosetta from the
# repo root) so that didn't feel right. For now this is what we have.
