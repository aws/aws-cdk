|cdk| Concepts
##############

This topic describes some of the concepts (the why and how)
behind the |cdk|.
It also discusses the advantages of a |l2| over a low-level |l1|.

|cdk| apps are represented as a hierarchal structure we call the *construct
tree*. Every node in the tree is a |construct-class| object. The
root of an |cdk| app is typically an |app-class| construct. Apps
contain one or more |stack-class| constructs, which are deployable
units of your app.

This composition of constructs gives you the flexibility to architect your app, such as
having a stack deployed in multiple regions. Stacks represent a collection of AWS resources, either directly or
indirectly through a child construct that itself represents an AWS resource, such as an |SQS|
queue, an |SNS| topic, an |LAM| function, or an |DDB| table.

This composition of constructs also means you can easily create sharable constructs,
and make changes to any construct and have those changes available to consumers
as shared class libraries.
