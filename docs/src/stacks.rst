Stacks
######

A |stack| is an |cdk| construct that can be deployed into an AWS environment.
The combination of region and account becomes the stack's *environment*, as
described in :ref:`environments`. Most production apps consist of multiple stacks of
resources that are deployed as a single transaction using a resource
provisioning service like |CFN|. Any resources added directly or indirectly as
children of a stack are included in the stack's template as it is synthesized by
your |cdk| program.

Define an application stack by extending the |stack-class| class, as
shown in the following example.

.. code-block:: js

   import { Stack, StackProps } from '@aws-cdk/cdk'

   interface MyStackProps extends StackProps {
       encryptedStorage: boolean;
   }

   class MyStack extends Stack {
       constructor(parent: Construct, name: string, props?: MyStackProps) {
           super(parent, name, props);

           new MyStorageLayer(this, 'Storage', { encryptedStorage: props.encryptedStorage });
           new MyControlPlane(this, 'CPlane');
           new MyDataPlane(this, 'DPlane');
       }
   }

And then, add instances of this class to your app:

.. code-block:: js

    const app = new App();

    new MyStack(app, 'NorthAmerica', { env: { region: 'us-east-1' } });
    new MyStack(app, 'Europe', { env: { region: 'us-west-2' } });
