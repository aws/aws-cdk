Assets
######

Assets are local files or directories which can be bundled into CDK constructs
and apps. A common example is a directory which contains the handler code for an
AWS Lambda function, but assets can represent any artifact that is needed for
the appâ€™s operation.

When deploying an AWS CDK app that includes constructs with assets, the toolkit
will first upload all the assets to S3, and only then deploy the stacks. The S3
locations of the uploaded assets will be passed in as CloudFormation Parameters
to the relevant stacks.

For more details, see the :py:doc:`Assets <refs/_aws-cdk_assets>` library documentation.
