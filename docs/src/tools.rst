Command-line Toolkit (cdk)
==========================

``cdk`` (the |toolkit|) is the main tool you use to interact with your |*CDK App*|. It executes
the CDK app you have written and compiled, interrogates the application
model you have defined, and produces and deploys the |CFN| templates
generated by the |cdk|.

There are two ways that you can tell ``cdk`` what command to use to run your CDK app.
The first way is to include an explicit ``--app`` option whenever you use a ``cdk`` command:

.. code-block:: sh

   cdk --app 'node bin/main.js' synth

The second way is to add the following entry to
the file *cdk.json*:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "app": "node bin/main.js"
   }

Here are the actions you can take on your CDK app
(this is the output of the ``cdk --help`` command):

.. code-block:: sh

    Usage: cdk -a <cdk-app> COMMAND

    Commands:
      list                        Lists all stacks in the app          [aliases: ls]
      synthesize [STACKS..]       Synthesizes and prints the CloudFormation template
                                  for this stack                    [aliases: synth]
      bootstrap [ENVIRONMENTS..]  Deploys the CDK toolkit stack into an AWS
                                  environment
      deploy [STACKS..]           Deploys the stack(s) named STACKS into your AWS
                                  account
      destroy [STACKS..]          Destroy the stack(s) named STACKS
      diff [STACK]                Compares the specified stack with the deployed
                                  stack or a local template file
      metadata [STACK]            Returns all metadata associated with this stack
      init [TEMPLATE]             Create a new, empty CDK project from a template.
                                  Invoked without TEMPLATE, the app template will be
                                  used.
      docs                        Opens the documentation in a browser[aliases: doc]

      --strict             Do not construct stacks with warnings           [boolean]
      --ignore-errors      Ignores synthesis errors, which will likely produce an
                           invalid output                 [boolean] [default: false]

    If your app has a single stack, there is no need to specify the stack name

    If one of cdk.json or ~/.cdk.json exists, options specified there will be used
    as defaults. Settings in cdk.json take precedence.

.. _security-changes:

Security-related changes
========================

In order to protect you against unintended changes that affect your security posture,
the CDK toolkit will prompt you to approve security-related changes before deploying
them.

You change the level of changes that requires approval by specifying:

.. code-block::

   cdk deploy --require-approval LEVEL

Where ``LEVEL`` can be one of:

* ``never`` - approval is never required.
* ``any-change`` - require approval on any IAM or security-group related change.
* ``broadening`` (default) - require approval when IAM statements or traffic rules are added. Removals
  do not require approval.

The setting also be configured in **cdk.json**:

.. code-block:: js

    {
        "app": "...",
        "requireApproval": "never"
    }

.. _version-reporting:

Version Reporting
=================

In order to gain insights in how the |cdk| is used, the versions of libraries used by |cdk| applications are collected
and reported using a resource identified as ``AWS::CDK::Metadata`` that is added to CloudFormation templates, and can easily
be reviewed. This information may also be used to identify stacks using a package with known serious security or
reliability issues and contact their users with important information.

The |cdk| reports the name and version of npm modules that are loaded into the application at synthesis time, unless
their ``package.json`` file contains the ``"private": true`` attribute.

The ``AWS::CDK::Metadata`` resource looks like the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

   CDKMetadata:
     Type: "AWS::CDK::Metadata"
     Properties:
       Modules: "@aws-cdk/core=0.7.2-beta,@aws-cdk/s3=0.7.2-beta,lodash=4.17.10"

.. _version_reporting_opt_out:

Opting-out from Version Reporting
---------------------------------

To out-out, use one of the following methods:

* Use the ``--no-version-reporting`` in ``cdk`` invocations:

    .. code-block:: sh

        cdk --no-version-reporting synth

* Set ``versionReporting`` to ``false`` in **./cdk.json** or **~/cdk.json**:

    .. code-block:: js

        {
          "app": "...",
          "versionReporting": false
        }

Plugins
=======

The |cdk| toolkit provides extension points that enable users to augment the features provided by
the toolkit. There is currently only one extension point, allowing users to define custom AWS
credential providers, but other extension points may be added in the future as the needs arise.

Loading Plugins
---------------

Plugins can be loaded by providing the Node module name (or path) to the CDK toolkit:

1. Using the ``--plugin`` command line option (which can be specified multiple times):

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cdk list --plugin=module
      $ cdk deploy --plugin=module_1 --plugin=module_2

2. Adding entries to the ``~/.cdk.json`` or ``cdk.json`` file:

   .. code-block:: js

      {
        // ...
        "plugin": [
            "module_1",
            "module_2"
        ],
        // ...
      }

Authoring Plugins
-----------------

Plugins must be authored in TypeScript or Javascript, and are defined by implementing a Node module
that implements the following protocol, and using :js:class:`~aws-cdk.PluginHost` methods:

.. tabs::
    .. code-tab:: typescript

        import cdk = require('aws-cdk');

        export = {
            version: '1', // Version of the plugin infrastructure (currently always '1')
            init(host: cdk.PluginHost): void {
                // Your plugin initialization hook.
                // Use methods of ``host`` to register custom code with the CDK toolkit
            }
        };

    .. code-tab:: javascript

        export = {
            version: '1', // Version of the plugin infrastructure (currently always '1')
            init(host) {
                // Your plugin initialization hook.
                // Use methods of ``host`` to register custom code with the CDK toolkit
            }
        };

Credential Provider Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Custom credential providers are classes implementing the
:js:class:`~aws-cdk.CredentialProviderSource` interface, and registered to the toolkit using
the :js:func:`~aws-cdk.PluginHost.registerCredentialProviderSource` method.

.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: typescript

      import cdk = require('aws-cdk');
      import aws = require('aws-sdk');

      class CustomCredentialProviderSource implements cdk.CredentialProviderSource {
        public async isAvailable(): Promise<boolean> {
          // Return ``false`` if the plugin could determine it cannot be used (for example,
          // if it depends on files that are not present on this host).
          return true;
        }

        public async canProvideCredentials(accountId: string): Promise<boolean> {
          // Return ``false`` if the plugin is unable to provide credentials for the
          // requested account (for example if it's not managed by the credentials
          // system that this plugin adds support for).
          return true;
        }

        public async getProvider(accountId: string, mode: cdk.Mode): Promise<aws.Credentials> {
          let credentials: aws.Credentials;
          // Somehow obtain credentials in ``credentials``, and return those.
          return credentials;
        }
      }

      export = {
        version = '1',
        init(host: cdk.PluginHost): void {
          // Register the credential provider to the PluginHost.
          host.registerCredentialProviderSource(new CustomCredentialProviderSource());
        }
      };

   .. code-tab:: javascript

      class CustomCredentialProviderSource {
        async isAvailable() {
          // Return ``false`` if the plugin could determine it cannot be used (for example,
          // if it depends on files that are not present on this host).
          return true;
        }

        async canProvideCredentials(accountId) {
          // Return ``false`` if the plugin is unable to provide credentials for the
          // requested account (for example if it's not managed by the credentials
          // system that this plugin adds support for).
          return true;
        }

        async getProvider(accountId, mode) {
          let credentials;
          // Somehow obtain credentials in ``credentials``, and return those.
          return credentials;
        }
      }

      export = {
        version = '1',
        init(host) {
          // Register the credential provider to the PluginHost.
          host.registerCredentialProviderSource(new CustomCredentialProviderSource());
        }
      };

Note that the credentials obtained from the providers for a given account and mode will be cached,
and as a consequence it is strongly advised that the credentials objects returned are self-refreshing,
as descibed in the `AWS SDK for Javascript documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Credentials.html>`_.
