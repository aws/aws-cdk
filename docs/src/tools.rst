Command-line Toolkit (cdk)
==========================

``cdk`` (the |toolkit|) is the main tool you use to interact with your |*CDK App*|. It will execute
the CDK app you have written and compiled, interrogate the application
model you have defined, and produce and deploy the CloudFormation templates
generated by it.

You have to tell ``cdk`` what command to use to run your CDK app using the
``--app`` option. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   cdk --app 'node bin/main.js' synth

Because this is rather tedious to repeat every time, you will generally put
this option in a file called *cdk.json*:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "app": "node bin/main.js"
   }

Below are the actions you can take on your CDK app:

.. code-block:: sh

   Usage: cdk -a <cloud-executable> COMMAND

   Commands:
     docs                        Opens the documentation in a browser
     list                        Lists all stacks in the cloud executable (alias:
                                 ls)
     synth [STACKS..]            Synthesizes and prints the cloud formation
                                 template for this stack (alias: synthesize,
                                 construct, cons)
     bootstrap [ENVIRONMENTS..]  Deploys the CDK toolkit stack into an AWS
                                 environment
     deploy [STACKS...]          Deploys the stack(s) named STACKS into your AWS
                                 account
     destroy [STACKS...]         Destroy the stack(s) named STACKS
     diff [STACK]                Compares the specified stack with the deployed
                                 stack or a local template file
     metadata [STACK]            Returns all metadata associated with this stack
     init [TEMPLATE]             Create a new, empty CDK project from a template.
                                 Invoked without TEMPLATE, the app template will be
                                 used.
     doctor                      Check your set-up for potential problems

   Options:
     --app, -a            REQUIRED: Command-line for executing your CDK app (e.g.
                          "node bin/my-app.js")                            [string]
     --context, -c        Add contextual string parameter.                  [array]

     --strict             Do not construct stacks with warnings           [boolean]
     --ignore-errors      Ignores synthesis errors, which will likely produce an
                          invalid output                 [boolean] [default: false]

     --help               Show help                                       [boolean]


   If your app has a single stack, there is no need to specify the stack name

   If one of cdk.json or ~/.cdk.json exists, options specified there will be used
   as defaults. Settings in cdk.json take precedence.

.. _version-reporting:

Version Reporting
=================

In order to gain insights in how the |cdk| is used, the versions of libraries used by |cdk| applications are collected
and reported using a resource identified as ``AWS::CDK::Metadata`` that is added to CloudFormation templates, and can easily
be reviewed. This information may also be used to identify stacks using a package with known serious security or
reliability issues and contact their users with important information.

The |cdk| reports the name and version of npm modules that are loaded into the application at synthesis time, unless
their ``package.json`` file contains the ``"private": true`` attribute.

The ``AWS::CDK::Metadata`` resource looks like the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

   CDKMetadata:
     Type: "AWS::CDK::Metadata"
     Properties:
       Modules: "@aws-cdk/core=0.7.2-beta,@aws-cdk/s3=0.7.2-beta,lodash=4.17.10"

.. _version-reporting-opt-out:

Opting-out from Version Reporting
---------------------------------

To out-out, use one of the following methods:

* Use the ``--no-version-reporting`` in ``cdk`` invocations:

    .. code-block:: sh

        cdk --no-version-reporting synth

* Set ``versionReporting`` to ``false`` in **./cdk.json** or **~/cdk.json**:

    .. code-block:: js

        {
          "app": "...",
          "versionReporting": false
        }

Plugins
=======

The |cdk| toolkit provides extension points that enable users to augment the features provided by
the toolkit. There is currently only one extension point, allowing users to define custom AWS
credential providers, but other extension points may be added in the future as the needs arise.

Loading Plugins
---------------

Plugins can be loaded by providing the Node module name (or path) to the CDK toolkit:

1. Using the ``--plugin`` command line option (which can be specified multiple times):

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cdk list --plugin=module
      $ cdk deploy --plugin=module_1 --plugin=module_2

2. Adding entries to the ``~/.cdk.json`` or ``cdk.json`` file:

   .. code-block:: js

      {
        // ...
        "plugin": [
            "module_1",
            "module_2"
        ],
        // ...
      }

Authoring Plugins
-----------------

Plugins must be authored in TypeScript or Javascript, and are defined by implementing a Node module
that implements the following protocol, and using :js:class:`~aws-cdk.PluginHost` methods:

.. tabs::
    .. code-tab:: typescript

        import cdk = require('aws-cdk');

        export = {
            version: '1', // Version of the plugin infrastructure (currently always '1')
            init(host: cdk.PluginHost): void {
                // Your plugin initialization hook.
                // Use methods of ``host`` to register custom code with the CDK toolkit
            }
        };

    .. code-tab:: javascript

        export = {
            version: '1', // Version of the plugin infrastructure (currently always '1')
            init(host) {
                // Your plugin initialization hook.
                // Use methods of ``host`` to register custom code with the CDK toolkit
            }
        };

Credential Provider Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Custom credential providers are classes implementing the
:js:class:`~aws-cdk.CredentialProviderSource` interface, and registered to the toolkit using
the :js:func:`~aws-cdk.PluginHost.registerCredentialProviderSource` method.

.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: typescript

      import cdk = require('aws-cdk');
      import aws = require('aws-sdk');

      class CustomCredentialProviderSource implements cdk.CredentialProviderSource {
        public async isAvailable(): Promise<boolean> {
          // Return ``false`` if the plugin could determine it cannot be used (for example,
          // if it depends on files that are not present on this host).
          return true;
        }

        public async canProvideCredentials(accountId: string): Promise<boolean> {
          // Return ``false`` if the plugin is unable to provide credentials for the
          // requested account (for example if it's not managed by the credentials
          // system that this plugin adds support for).
          return true;
        }

        public async getProvider(accountId: string, mode: cdk.Mode): Promise<aws.Credentials> {
          let credentials: aws.Credentials;
          // Somehow obtain credentials in ``credentials``, and return those.
          return credentials;
        }
      }

      export = {
        version = '1',
        init(host: cdk.PluginHost): void {
          // Register the credential provider to the PluginHost.
          host.registerCredentialProviderSource(new CustomCredentialProviderSource());
        }
      };

   .. code-tab:: javascript

      class CustomCredentialProviderSource {
        async isAvailable() {
          // Return ``false`` if the plugin could determine it cannot be used (for example,
          // if it depends on files that are not present on this host).
          return true;
        }

        async canProvideCredentials(accountId) {
          // Return ``false`` if the plugin is unable to provide credentials for the
          // requested account (for example if it's not managed by the credentials
          // system that this plugin adds support for).
          return true;
        }

        async getProvider(accountId, mode) {
          let credentials;
          // Somehow obtain credentials in ``credentials``, and return those.
          return credentials;
        }
      }

      export = {
        version = '1',
        init(host) {
          // Register the credential provider to the PluginHost.
          host.registerCredentialProviderSource(new CustomCredentialProviderSource());
        }
      };

Note that the credentials obtained from the providers for a given account and mode will be cached,
and as a consequence it is strongly advised that the credentials objects returned are self-refreshing,
as descibed in the `AWS SDK for Javascript documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Credentials.html>`_.
