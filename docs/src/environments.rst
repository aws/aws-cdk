Environments and Authentication

The |cdk| refers to the combination of an account ID and a Region as an *environment*.
The simplest environment is the one you get by default,
which is the one you get when you have set up your credentials and a default Region as described in
:ref:`credentials`.

When you create a |stack-class| instance, you can supply the target deployment environment
for the stack using the **env** property, as shown in the following example,
where REGION is the Region in which you want to create the stack and ACCOUNT is your account ID.

.. code:: js

   new MyStack(app, { env: { region: 'REGION', account: 'ACCOUNT' } });

For each of the two arguments **region** and **account**, the |cdk| uses the
following lookup procedure:

- If **region** or **account** are provided directly as an property to the
  Stack, use that.
- Otherwise, read **default-account** and **default-region** from the application's context.
  These can be set in the |toolkit| in either the local |cx-json| file or the global version in
  *$HOME/.cdk* on Linux or MacOS or *%USERPROFILE%\\.cdk* on Windows.
- If these are not defined, it will determine them as follows:
  
  - **account**: use account from default SDK credentials. Environment
    variables are tried first (**AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**),
    followed by credentials in *$HOME/.aws/credentials* on Linux or MacOS
    or *%USERPROFILE%\\.aws\\credentials* on Windows.
  - **region**: use the default region configured in *$HOME/.aws/config* on
    Linux or MacOS or *%USERPROFILE%\\.aws\\config* on Windows.
  - You can set these defaults manually, but we recommend you use ``aws
    configure``, as described in the :doc:`getting-started` topic.

We recommend that you use the default environment for development stacks,
and explicitly specify accounts and Regions for production stacks.

.. note::

   Note that even though the region and account might explicitly be set on your
   Stack, if you run ``cdk deploy`` the |cdk| will still use the
   currently-configured SDK credentials, as provided via the **AWS_**
   environment variables or ``aws configure``. This means that if you want to
   deploy stacks to multiple accounts, you will have to set the correct
   credentials for each invocation to ``cdk deploy STACK``.

   In the future, we will provide the ability to specify credential sources for
   individual accounts so that you can deploy to multiple accounts using one
   invocation of ``cdk deploy``, but this feature is not available yet.
