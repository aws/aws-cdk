### General Availability of the AWS Cloud Development Kit!! 🎉🎉🥂🥂🍾🍾

We are excited to announce the 1.0.0 release of the AWS CDK –
including GA support for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python!

We want to thank all of our early customers, and the hundreds of contributors,
for all the help and support in making this release a reality.
Thank you for the patience to deal with the many, many breaking changes that happened along the way.
This product would not be what it is today if it weren't for all the feedback,
diligent issue reporting (bugs, missing features, unclear documentation, etc.),
and code contributions from the community.

Special thanks go out to a few of our most prolific contributors who went above and beyond to help improve the CDK:

* [Mike Cowgill](https://github.com/moofish32)
* [Jonathan Goldwasser](https://github.com/jogold)
* [Breland Miley](https://github.com/mindstorms6)
* [Piradeep Kandasamy](https://github.com/pkandasamy91)
* [Hsing-Hui Hsu](https://github.com/SoManyHs)

* [Clare Liguori](https://github.com/clareliguori)
* [Yenlin Chen](https://github.com/hencrice)
* [Lee Packham](https://github.com/leepa)

1.0.0 is a huge milestone for us, but it's still only the beginning!
We are excited to continue evolving the CDK, to introduce support for new languages and capabilities,
and to continue working closely with the open-source community.

* **cli:** The CLI no longer accepts `--rename`, and the stack
                 names are now immutable on the stack artifact.
* **sns:** using a queue, lambda, email, URL as SNS Subscriber now
requires an integration object from the `@aws-cdk/aws-sns-subscribers`

Load Balancer as an Alias Record Target now requires an integration
object from the `@aws-cdk/aws-route53-targets` package.
* **s3:** The `IBucket.arnForObject` method no longer
concatenates path fragments on your behalf. Pass the `/`-concatenated
key pattern instead.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **cloudtrail:** The `CloudTrail.addS3EventSelector` accepts an options
object instead of only a `ReadWriteType` value.
* **codedeploy:** If an existing role is provided to a LambdaDeploymentGroup,
you will need to provide the assuming service principal (`codedeploy.amazonaws.com`)
yourself.
* **core:**$$** 'Aws' class returns unscoped Tokens, introduce a
new class 'ScopedAws' which returns scoped Tokens.
* **ssm:** Rename `parameter.valueAsString` =>
`parameter.stringValue`, rename `parameter.valueAsList` =>
`parameter.stringListValue`, rename `ssmParameter.parameterValue` =>
`ssmParameter.stringValue` or `ssmParameter.stringListValue` depending
on type, rename `secretString.value` => `secretString.stringValue`,
rename `secret.toSecretString()` =>`secret.secretString`
* **cloudwatch:** Rename 'MetricAarmProps' => 'MetricAlarmProps'.
* **core:** `Stack.find(c)` and `Stack.tryFind(c)` were
replaced by `c.node.stack`.
* **dynamodb:** `partitionKey` is now a required property when defining a
`dynamodb.Table`. The `addPartitionKey` and `addSortKey` methods have been removed.
* **cdk:** Tag aspects use this feature and any consumers of this
implementation must change from `myConstruct.apply( ... )` to
`myConstruct.node.apply( ... )`.
* **ecs:** Rename 'addDefaultAutoScalingGroupCapacity' =>
'addCapacity', 'addAutoScalingGroupCapacity' => 'addAutoScalingGroup'.
* **codepipelines:** the CodePipeline Stage class is no longer a Construct,
and cannot be instantiated directly, only through calling Pipeline#addStage;
which now takes an Object argument instead of a String.
* **codepipelines:** the CodePipeline Actions are no longer Constructs.
* **codepipelines:** the CodePipeline Action name is now part of the Action props,
instead of being a separate parameter.
* **codepipelines:** the Pipeline#addToPipeline methods in Resources like S3, CodeBuild, CodeCommit etc.
have been renamed to `toCodePipelineAction`.
* **aws-eks:** For `AutoScalingGroup`, renamed `minSize` =>
`minCapacity`, `maxSize` => `maxCapacity`, for consistency with
`desiredCapacity` and also Application AutoScaling.
For ECS's `addDefaultAutoScalingGroupCapacity()`, `instanceCount` =>
`desiredCapacity` and the function now takes an ID (pass
`"DefaultAutoScalingGroup"` to avoid interruption to your deployments).

## [0.22.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/compare/v0.21.0...v0.22.0) (2019-01-10)

This is a major release with multiple breaking changes in the core layers.
Please consult the __breaking changes__ section below for details.

We are focusing these days on finalizing the common patterns and APIs of the CDK
framework and the AWS Construct Library, which is why you are seeing all these
breaking changes. Expect a few more releases with changes of that nature as we
stabilize these APIs, so you might want to hold off with upgrading. We will
communicate when this foundational work is complete.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **Cross-stack references:** if you are using `export()` and `import()` to share constructs between stacks, you can stop doing that, instead of `FooImportProps` accept an `IFoo` directly on the consuming stack, and use that object as usual.
* `ArnUtils.fromComponents()` and `ArnUtils.parse()` have been moved onto `Stack`.
* All CloudFormation pseudo-parameter (such as `AWS::AccountId` etc) are now also accessible via `Stack`, as `stack.accountId` etc.
* All CloudFormation intrinsic functions are now represented as static methods under the `Fn` class (e.g. `Fn.join(...)` instead of `new FnJoin(...).toString()`)
* `resolve()` has been moved to `this.node.resolve()`.
* `CloudFormationJSON.stringify()` has been moved to `this.node.stringifyJson()`. `validate()` now should be `protected`.
* The deprecated `cloudformation.XxxResource` classes have been removed. Use the `CfnXxx` classes instead.
* Any `CfnXxx` resource attributes that represented a list of strings are now typed as `string[]`s (via #1144). Attributes that represent strings, are still typed as `string` (#712) and all other attribute types are represented as `cdk.Token`.
* **route53:** The `route53.TXTRecord` class was renamed to `route53.TxtRecord`.
* **route53:** record classes now require a `zone` when created (not assuming zone is the parent construct).
* **lambda:** the static "metric" methods moved from `lambda.FunctionRef` to `lambda.Function`.
* Many AWS resource classes have been changed to conform to API guidelines:
  - `XxxRef` abstract classes are now `IXxx` interfaces
  - `XxxRefProps` are now `XxxImportProps`
  - `XxxRef.import(...)` are now `Xxx.import(...)` accept `XxxImportProps` and return `IXxx`
  - `export(): XxxImportProps` is now defined in `IXxx` and implemented by imported resources

from `Role` to `IRole`. This is needed to use imported Roles when creating Actions.
* **aws-codebuild:** this changes the API of CodeBuild's GitHub and BitBucket Sources
to take an owner/repo pair instead of an entire cloneUrl,
to make it consistent with the GitHubSourceAction in the CodePipeline package. Also adds handling the reportBuildStatus and insecureSsl Source properties.
* **codebuild:** the `includeBuildID` property of
`S3BucketBuildArtifacts` was renamed to `includeBuildId` (note the
lower-case trailing `d`).

- **aws-codepipeline**: switch to webhooks instead of polling by default for the GitHub ([#1074](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/1074))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **aws-codebuild:** this changes the way CodeBuild Sources are constructed (we moved away from multiple parameters in the constructor, in favor of the more idiomatic property interface).
- **aws-elasticloadbalancingv2:** `targetGroup.listenerDependency()` has been renamed to `targetGroup.loadBalancerDependency()`.

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/compare/v0.16.0...v0.17.0) (2018-11-14)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **aws-ec2:** Method signature of VpcPublicSubnet.addDefaultIGWRouteEntry changed in order to add a dependency on gateway attachment completing before creating the public route to the gateway. Instead of passing a gateway ID string, pass in a cloudformation.InternetGatewayResource object and a cloudformation.VPCGatewayAttachmentResource object.
- If you were using `DockerHub.image()` to reference docker hub images, use `ContainerImage.fromDockerHub()` instead.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **aws-codedeploy:** this changes the API of the CodeDeploy Pipeline Action to take the DeploymentGroup AWS Construct as an argument instead of the names of the Application and Deployment Group.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- The ec2.Connections object has been changed to be able to manage multiple security groups. The relevant property has been changed from `securityGroup` to `securityGroups` (an array of security group objects).
- **aws-codecommit:** this modifies the default behavior of the CodeCommit Action. It also changes the internal API contract between the aws-codepipeline-api module and the CodePipeline Actions in the service packages.
- **applets:** The applet schema has changed to allow Multiple applets can be define in one file by structuring the files like this:
- **applets:** The applet schema has changed to allow definition of multiple applets in the same file.

The schema now looks like this:

```
applets:
  MyApplet:
    type: ./my-applet-file
    properties:
      property1: value
      ...
```

By starting an applet specifier with npm://, applet modules can directly be referenced in NPM. You can include a version specifier (@1.2.3) to reference specific versions.

- **aws-sqs:** `queue.grantReceiveMessages` has been removed. It is unlikely that this would be sufficient to interact with a queue. Alternatively you can use `queue.grantConsumeMessages` or `queue.grant('sqs:ReceiveMessage')` if there's a need to only grant this action.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- DynamoDB AutoScaling: Instead of `addReadAutoScaling()`, call `autoScaleReadCapacity()`, and similar for write scaling.
- CloudFormation resource usage: If you use L1s, you may need to change some `XxxName` properties back into `Name`. These will match the CloudFormation property names.
- You must use the matching `aws-cdk` toolkit when upgrading to this version, or context providers will cease to work. All existing cached context values in `cdk.json` will be invalidated and refreshed.

## [0.13.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0) (2018-10-19)

### Highlights

- **A new construct library for AWS Step Functions** ([docs](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions/README.md)). The library provides rich APIs for modeling state machines by exposing a programmatic interface for [Amazon State Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html).
- **A new construct library for Amazon S3 bucket deployments** ([docs](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-s3-deployment/README.md)). You can use now automatically populate an S3 Bucket from a .zip file or a local directory. This is a building block for end-to-end support for static websites in the AWS CDK.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **aws-apigateway:** specifying a path no longer works. If you used to provide a '/', remove it. Otherwise, you will have to supply `proxy: false` and construct more complex resource paths yourself.
- **aws-lambda:** The construct `lambda.InlineJavaScriptLambda` is no longer supported. Use `lambda.Code.inline` instead; `lambda.Runtime.NodeJS43Edge` runtime is removed. CloudFront docs [stipulate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-requirements-limits.html#lambda-requirements-lambda-function-configuration) that you should use node6.10 or node8.10\. It is always possible to use any value by instantiating a `lambda.Runtime` object.

## [0.12.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0) (2018-10-12)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This release includes a [fix](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/911) for a bug that would make the toolkit unusable for multi-stack applications. In order to benefit from this fix, a globally installed CDK toolkit must also be updated:

```shell
$ npm i -g aws-cdk
$ cdk --version
0.12.0 (build ...)
```

Like always, you will also need to update your project's library versions:

- **aws-codebuild:** allow passing oauth token to GitHubEnterpriseSource ([#908](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/908)) ([c23da91](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/c23da91))
- **toolkit:** multi-stack apps cannot be synthesized or deployed ([#911](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/911)) ([5511076](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/5511076)), closes [#868](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/868) [#294](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/294) [#910](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/910)

### Features

- **aws-cloudformation:** add permission management to CreateUpdate and Delete Stack CodePipeline Actions. ([#880](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/880)) ([8b3ae43](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/8b3ae43))
- **aws-codepipeline:** make input and output artifact names optional when creating Actions. ([#845](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/845)) ([3d91c93](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/3d91c93))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **aws-codepipeline:** this commit contains the following breaking changes:

  - Rename 'artifactName' in Action construction properties to 'outputArtifactName'
  - Rename the 'artifact' property of Actions to 'outputArtifact'
  - No longer allow adding output artifacts to Actions by instantiating the Artifact class
  - Rename Action#input/outputArtifacts properties to _input/_outputArtifacts

Previously, we always required customers to explicitly name the output artifacts the Actions used in the Pipeline, and to explicitly "wire together" the outputs of one Action as inputs to another. With this change, the CodePipeline Construct generates artifact names, if the customer didn't provide one explicitly, and tries to find the first available output artifact to use as input to a newly created Action that needs it, thus turning both the input and output artifacts from required to optional properties.

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0) (2018-10-11)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This release includes a [breaking change](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/868) in the toolkit <=> app protocol. This means that in order to synthesize CDK apps that use this version, the globally installed CDK toolkit must also be updated:

```shell
$ npm i -g aws-cdk
$ cdk --version
0.11.0 (build ...)
```

Like always, you will also need to update your project's library versions:

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **framework:** The `cdk.App` constructor doesn't accept any arguments, and `app.run()` does not return a `string` anymore. All AWS CDK apps in all languages would need to be modified to adhere to the new API of the `cdk.App` construct.

  Instead of:

  ```
  const app = new App(process.argv); // ERROR
  // add stacks
  process.stdout.write(app.run());   // ERROR
  ```

  The new usage is:

  ```
  const app = new App();
  // add stacks
  app.run();
  ```

- **framework:** The CDK is no longer shipped with built-in support for JSX. You can still use JSX but you will have to manually configure it.
- **aws-iam:** `PolicyDocument`, `PolicyStatement` and all `PolicyPrincipal` classes moved from the @aws-cdk/cdk module and into the @aws-cdk/aws-iam module.
- **aws-codepipeline-api**: `Artifact.subartifact` method of the CodePipeline API was renamed to `Artifact.atPath`.
- constructor signature of `TagManager` has changed. `initialTags` is now passed inside a props object.
- **util:** @aws-cdk/util is no longer available
- **aws-elasticloadbalancingv2:** Adds classes for modeling Application and Network Load Balancers. AutoScalingGroups now implement the interface that makes constructs a load balancing target. The breaking change is that Security Group rule identifiers have been changed in order to make adding rules more reliable. No code changes are necessary but existing deployments may experience unexpected changes.
- **aws-cloudformation:** this renames all CloudFormation Actions for CodePipeline to bring them in line with Actions defined in other service packages.
- **aws-codepipeline, aws-codecommit, aws-s3:** change the names of the source Actions from XxxSource to XxxSourceAction. This is to align them with the other Actions, like Build. Also, CodeBuild has the concept of Sources, so it makes sense to strongly differentiate between the two.

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/compare/v0.9.2...v0.10.0) (2018-09-27)

This release introduces a better way to "escape" L2 constructs in case of missing features by adding the ability to add arbitrary overrides for resource properties:

```typescript
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'L2Bucket');

// access L1
const bucketResource = bucket.findChild('Resource') as s3.cloudformation.BucketResource;

// strongly-typed overrides
bucketResource.propertyOverrides.bucketName = 'NewBucketName';

// weakly-typed overrides
bucketResource.addPropertyOverride('BucketName', 'NewerBucketName');
```

## [0.9.2](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/compare/v0.9.1...v0.9.2) (2018-09-20)

**NOTICE**: This release includes a framework-wide [**breaking change**](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/712) which changes the type of all the string resource attributes across the framework. Instead of using strong-types that extend `cdk.Token` (such as `QueueArn`, `TopicName`, etc), we now represent all these attributes as normal `string`s, and codify the tokens into the string (using the feature introduced in [#168](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/168)).

Furthermore, the `cdk.Arn` type has been removed. In order to format/parse ARNs, use the static methods on `cdk.ArnUtils`.

See motivation and discussion in [#695](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/695).

### Breaking Changes

- **cfn2ts:** use stringified tokens for resource attributes instead of strong types ([#712](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/712)) ([6508f78](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/6508f78)), closes [#518](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/518) [#695](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/695) [#744](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/744)
- **aws-dynamodb:** Attribute type for keys, changes the signature of the `addPartitionKey` and `addSortKey` methods to be consistent across the board. ([#720](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/720)) ([e6cc189](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/e6cc189))

- **cdk:** "cdk init" java template is broken ([#732](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/732)) ([281c083](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/281c083)), closes [#711](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/711) [awslabs/jsii#233](https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/233)

## 0.8.2 - 2018-08-15

### Features

- **@aws-cdk/cdk**: Tokens can now be transparently embedded into strings and encoded into JSON without losing their semantics. This makes it possible to treat late-bound (deploy-time) values as if they were regular strings ([@rix0rrr] in [#518](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/518)).
- **@aws-cdk/aws-s3**: add support for bucket notifications to Lambda, SNS, and SQS targets ([@eladb] in [#201](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/201), [#560](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/560), [#561](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/561), [#564](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/564))
- **@aws-cdk/cdk**: non-alphanumeric characters can now be used as construct identifiers ([@eladb] in [#556](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/556))
- **@aws-cdk/aws-iam**: add support for `maxSessionDuration` for Roles ([@eladb] in [#545](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/545)).

### Changes

- **@aws-cdk/aws-lambda** (_**BREAKING**_): most classes renamed to be shorter and more in line with official service naming (`Lambda` renamed to `Function` or ommitted) ([@eladb] in [#550](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/550))
- **@aws-cdk/aws-codepipeline** (_**BREAKING**_): move all CodePipeline actions from `@aws-cdk/aws-xxx-codepipeline` packages into the regular `@aws-cdk/aws-xxx` service packages ([@skinny85] in [#459](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/459)).
- **@aws-cdk/aws-custom-resources** (_**BREAKING**_): package was removed, and the Custom Resource construct added to the **@aws-cdk/aws-cloudformation** package ([@rix0rrr] in [#513](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/513))

### Fixes

- **@aws-cdk/aws-lambda**: Lambdas that are triggered by CloudWatch Events now show up in the console, and can only be triggered the indicated Event Rule. _**BREAKING**_ for middleware writers (as this introduces an API change), but transparent to regular consumers ([@eladb] in [#558](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/558))
- **@aws-cdk/aws-codecommit**: fix a bug where `pollForSourceChanges` could not be set to `false` ([@maciejwalkowiak] in [#534](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/534))
- **aws-cdk**: don't fail if the `~/.aws/credentials` file is missing ([@RomainMuller] in [#541](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/541))
- **@aws-cdk/aws-cloudformation**: fix a bug in the CodePipeline actions to correctly support TemplateConfiguration ([@mindstorms6] in [#571](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/571)).
- **@aws-cdk/aws-cloudformation**: fix a bug in the CodePipeline actions to correctly support ParameterOverrides ([@mindstorms6] in [#574](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/574)).

### Known Issues

- `cdk init` will try to init a `git` repository and fail if no global `user.name` and `user.email` have been configured.

## 0.8.0 - 2018-07-31

**_This is the first public release of the AWS CDK!_**

- Change license to Apache-2.0 ([@RomainMuller] in [#428])
- Multiple README updates, including animated gif screencast, as preparation for public release ([@rix0rrr] in [#433], [@eladb] in [#439])
- Multiple documentation updates for public release ([@Doug-AWS] in [#420], [@eladb] in [#436])
- Toolkit (**bug fix**): Correctly account for `CDK::Metadata` in `cdk diff` ([@RomainMuller] in [#435])
- AWS CodeBuild (_**BREAKING**_): Usability improvements for the CodeBuild library ([@skinny85] in [#412])

## 0.7.4 - 2018-07-26

### Highlights

- A huge shout-out to our first external contributor, [@moofish32], for many valuable improvements to the EC2 VPC construct ([@moofish32] in [#250]).
- The `AWS::CDK::Metadata` resource is injected to templates to analyze usage and notify about deprecated modules to improve security. To opt-out, use the switch `--no-version-reporting` or set `version-reporting` to `false` in your `cdk.json` ([@RomainMuller] in [#221]).
- Added capability for bundling local assets (files/directories) and referencing them in CDK constructs. This allows, for example, to define Lambda functions with runtime code in the same project and deploy them using the toolkit ([@eladb] in [#371]).
- Reorganization of CodePipeline actions into separate libraries ([@skinny85] in [#401] and [#402]).
- A new library for CloudWatch Logs ([@rix0rrr] in [#307]).

### AWS Construct Library

- _**BREAKING**_: All AWS libraries renamed from `@aws-cdk/xxx` to `@aws-cdk/aws-xxx` in order to avoid conflicts with framework modules ([@RomainMuller] in [#384]).
- _**BREAKING**_: The **@aws-cdk/resources** module has been removed. Low-level CloudFormation resources (e.g. `BucketResource`) are now integrated into their respective library under the `cloudformation` namespace to improves discoverability and organization of the layers ([@RomainMuller] in [#264]).

### Framework

- Introducing **CDK Assets** which are local files or directories that can be "bundled" into CDK constructs and apps. During deployment assets are packaged (i.e. zipped), uploaded to S3 and their deployed location can be referenced in CDK apps via the `s3BucketName` and `s3ObjectKey` and `s3Url` and read permissions can be granted via `asset.grantRead(principal)` ([@eladb] in [#371])
- Return dummy values instead of fail synthesis if environmental context (AZs, SSM parameters) doesn't exist in order to support unit tests. When synthesizing through the toolkit, an error will be displayed if the context cannot be found ([@eladb] in [#227])
- Added `construct.addError(msg)`, `addWarning(msg)` and `addInfo(msg)` which will emit messages during synthesis via the toolkit. Errors will fail synthesis (unless `--ignore-errors` is used), warnings will be displayed and will fail synthesis if `--strict` is used ([@eladb] in [#227])

### Command Line Toolkit

- The toolkit now injects a special CloudFormation resource `AWS::CDK::Metadata` to all synthesized templates which includes library versions used in the app. This allows the CDK team to analyze usage and notify users if they use deprecated versions ([@RomainMuller] in [#221]).
- **Bug fix**: Fixed "unknown command: docs" ([@RomainMuller] in [#256])
- Changed output of `cdk list` to just print stack names (scripting-compatible). Use `cdk ls -l` to print full info ([@eladb] in [#380])

### AWS EC2

- _**BREAKING**_: Add the ability customize subnet configurations. Subnet allocation was changed to improve IP space efficiency. `VpcNetwork` instances will need to be replaced ([@moofish32] in [#250])
- _**BREAKING**_: Renamed `Fleet` to `AutoScalingGroup` to align with service terminology ([@RomainMuller] in [#318])

### AWS Lambda

- Supports runtime code via local files or directories through assets ([@eladb] in [#405])
- Support custom execution role in props ([@rix0rrr] in [#205])
- Add static `metricAllConcurrentExecutions` and `metricAllUnreservedConcurrentExecutions` which returns account/region-level metrics for all functions ([@rix0rrr] in [#379])

### AWS CloudWatch

- Added `Metric.grantMetricPutData` which grants cloudwatch:PutData to IAM principals ([@rix0rrr] in [#214])
- **Bug fix**: Allow text included in dashboard widgets to include characters that require JSON-escaping ([@eladb] in [#406]).

### AWS CloudWatch Logs (new)

- A new construct library for AWS CloudWatch Logs with support for log groups, metric filters, and subscription filters ([@rix0rrr] in [#307]).

### AWS S3

- Added `bucketUrl` and `urlForObject(key)` to `BucketRef` ([@eladb] in [#370])

### AWS CodeBuild

- Add CloudWatch metrics to `BuildProject` ([@eladb] in [#407])

### AWS CodePipeline

- _**BREAKING**_: Moved CodeCommit and CodeBuild and LambdaInvoke actions from the CodePipeline library to `@aws-cdk/aws-xxx-codepipline` modules ([@skinny85] in [#401] and [#402]).
- Added attributes `pipelineName` and `pipelineVersion` ([@eladb] in [#408])

### Docs

- **fix**: add instructions and fix Windows setup ([@mpiroc] in [#320])
- **fix**: show emphasis of modified code in code snippets ([@eladb] in [#396])

## 0.7.3 - 2018-07-09

### Highlights

- Introducing Java support (see the **Getting Started** documentation topic for instructions on how to set up a Java project).
- Introduce a new programming model for CloudWatch metrics, alarms and dashboards (see the [@aws-cdk/cloudwatch documentation]).
- Multiple documentation improvements (open with `cdk docs`).

### Known Issues

- Missing instructions for Windows Setup ([#138])
- `cdk docs` works but a message **Unknown command: docs** is printed ([#256])
- Java: passing `null` behaves differently than no arguments. Workaround is to build an empty object ([#157])

### Changes

- Introduce Java support ([@eladb] in [#229], [#245], [#148], [#149])
- Changed the way the beta archive is structured to no longer bundle a pre-installed `node_modules` directory but rather only a local npm repository. This changes the setup instructions to require `y-npm i -g aws-cdk` to install the toolkit on the system, which is more inline with the setup experience post-beta ([@RomainMuller] in [#161], [#162] and [awslabs/jsii#43]).
- CloudWatch (new): introduce a rich programming model for metrics, alarms and dashboards ([@rix0rrr] in [#180], [#194])
- S3 (feature): add support for SSE-S3 encryption ([@rix0rrr] in [#257])
- Lambda (feature): add support for node.js 8.10 runtime ([@RomainMuller] in [#187])
- Runtime Values (fix): use allowed characters in SSM parameter name when advertising a runtime value ([@eladb] in [#208])
- SNS (docs): convert examples in README into compiled code ([@rix0rrr] in [#107])
- Toolkit (feature): introduce `cdk doctor` to collect information for diagnostics ([@RomainMuller] in [#177])
- Toolkit (feature): align AWS credentials behavior to AWS CLI ([@RomainMuller] in [#175])
- Toolkit (performance): cache default AWS account ID on disk ([@eladb] in [#220])
- Docs: multiple updates ([@Doug-AWS] in [#142])
- Docs: improve topic on logical IDs ([@eladb] in [#209])
- Docs: add support for code snippets in multiple tabs ([@eladb] in [#231])
- Docs: rewrote the "Getting Started" documentation topic to include step-by-step project setup details instead of using `cdk-init`. This is in order to improve understanding of how the CDK works when users get started ([@eladb] in [#245])
- Resource bundler: generate `.d.ts` ([@rix0rrr] in [#172])

## 0.7.2 - 2018-06-19

- Add: initial construct library for [AWS Kinesis Data Streams] ([@sam-goodwin] in [#86])
- Update low-level resources from [CloudFormation resource specification]
- Update dependencies ([@eladb] in [#119])
- Fix: Adopt SDK-standard behavior when no environment is specified ([@RomainMuller] in [#128])
- Fix: Have cdk diff output render 'number' value changes ([@RomainMuller] in [#136])

### Known issues

- Windows setup has not been vetted and might be broken - **no workaround** ([#138])
- If region is not defined, error message is unclear - **workaround**: make sure to define `region` when running `aws configure` ([#131])
- `cdk docs` opens the index instead of the welcome page - **workaround**: click on "Welcome" in the sidebar ([#129])
- The runtime values library (**@aws-cdk/rtv**) is broken ([#151])

## 0.7.1 - 2018-06-15

### Framework

- Two-way IAM policy statement additions have been removed for S3 and SNS, because those services treat resource and identity policies as additive. KMS grants are still added on both resource and identity because KMS requires permissions set from both sides.

### Toolkit

- `cdk init` interface changed to accept the template name as a positional argument, and the language as an option. A `--list` option was added to allow listing available templates.
- `cdk-beta-npm` is a wrapper to `npm` that executes commands with a local registry that has the CDK packages available. It should be used instead of `npm` for subcommands such as `npm install`.
- CDK now respects `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable if set.

## 0.7.0 - 2018-06-13

### Framework

- _BREAKING_: All CDK packages are non under the scope `@aws-cdk` (e.g. `@aws-cdk/s3`).
- _BREAKING_: The `jsii` compiler now configures `tsconfig.json` to produce definition files (files with a .d.ts extension). This requires updating your existing `package.json` files `types` key to replace the .ts extension with a .d.ts extension.
- Java bindings now include static methods and constants.
- `SecretParameter` can be used to load values from the SSM parameter store during deployment and use them as `Secret`s.
- `Stack` is locked for mutations during synthesis to protect against accidental changes in lazy values.
- An overhaul of documentation updates, edits and improvements.

### ACM

- Fix: `cloudFrontDefaultCertificate` is mutually exclusive with `acmCertificateArn`.

### CloudFront (new)

- Added a new construct library for AWS CloudFront.

### CodeBuild

- Added support for specifying environment variables at the container and project levels.

### CodePipeline

- Fix: GitHub action "owner" changed to `ThirdParty`.
- Removed all fluent APIs
- Use "master" as the default branch for Source actions
- _BREAKING_: `AmazonS3SourceProps` - renamed `key` to `bucketKey`

### Custom Resources

- _BREAKING_: Require that Lambda is referenced explicitly when defining a custom resource. `SingletonLambda` can be used to encapsulate the custom resource's lambda function but only have a single instance of it in the stack.

### Events (new)

A new cross-stack programming model is introduced to support CloudWatch Events. Event sources implement `onXxx` methods for various events that can emitted by that source and event targets implement `IEventRuleTarget`, so they can be polymorphically added to rules.

```typescript
const repo = new Repository(stack, 'MyRepo', { repositoryName: 'my-repo' });
const project = new BuildProject(stack, 'MyProject', { source: new CodeCommitSource(repo) });

const topic = new Topic(stack, 'MyTopic');
topic.subscribeEmail('Personal', 'myteam@mycompany.com');

project.onStateChange(topic);
```

Coverage to all event sources and target will be added in subsequent releases.

Supported targets:

- `codebuild.BuildProject`
- `codepipline.Pipeline`
- `sns.Topic`

Supported sources:

- **CodeBuild**: `onStateChange`, `onPhaseChange`, `onBuildStarted`, `onBuildFailed`, `onBuildSucceeded`.
- **CodeCommit**: `onEvent`, `onStateChange`, `onReferenceCreated`, `onReferenceUpdated`, `onReferenceDeleted`, `onPullRequestStateChange`, `onCommentOnPullRequest`, `onCommentOnCommit`, `onCommit`.
- **CodePipeline**: `pipeline.onStateChange`, `stage.onStateChange`, `action.onStateChange`.

### IAM

- Add `CanonicalUserPrincipal`
- Add `statementCount` to `PolicyDocumennt`.
- Extended support for `FederatedPrincipal`.

### Lambda

- Add `initialPolicy` prop which allows specifying a set of `PolicyStatement`s upon definition.

### S3

- Added support for lifecycle rules
- Add `domainName` and `dualstackDomainName` attributes

### Serverless

- `version` field of `FunctionResource` is now optional.

### SNS

- _BREAKING_: `subscribeXxx` APIs now do not require a name when possible (for queue, Lambda).
- Unique SID assigned to resource policy statements.

### Toolkit

- `cdk docs` opens your browser with the bundled documentation content.
- `cdk init` interface changed to specify `--lang` and `--type` separately.
- Plug-in architecture improved.

## 0.6.0 - 2018-05-16

### AWS Construct Libraries

The main theme for this release is the stabilization of our framework APIs and an initial set of **AWS Construct Libraries**.

Previously, CDK users would normally to program against the `@aws-cdk/resources` library which included generated classes for all CloudFormation resources. For example, the `sqs.QueueResource` defined the **AWS::SQS::Queue** CloudFormation resource.

Starting in 0.6, we recommend that users define their infrastructure using a new set of _hand-crafted libraries_ we refer to as **AWS Construct Libraries** (we used to call these "Layer 2" or "L2"). These libraries include CDK constructs with rich and powerful object-oriented APIs for defining infrastructure.

For example:

```typescript
const vpc = new VpcNetwork(this, 'MyVpc');

const fleet = new Fleet(this, 'MyFleet', {
    vpc, instanceType: new InstanceTypePair(InstanceClass.M4, InstanceSize.XLarge),
    machineImage: new AmazonLinuxImage()
});

const clb = new ClassicLoadBalancer(this, 'LB', {
    vpc, internetFacing: true
});

clb.addListener({ externalPort: 80 });
clb.addTarget(fleet);
```

Synthesizing this stack to the us-east-1 region (which has 6 availability zones) will result in a CloudFormation template that contains 72 resources of 17 different resource types.

### Construct initializers now include a name

All constructs in a CDK stack must have a name unique amongst its siblings. Names are used to allocate stack-wide logical IDs for each CloudFormation resource. Prior to this release, the name of the class was implicitly used as a default name for the construct. As much as this was convenient, we realized it was misleading and potentially unsafe, since a change in a class name will result in changes to all logical IDs for all resources created within that tree, and changes to logical IDs result in **resource replacement** since CloudFormation cannot associate the existing resource with the new resource (this is the purpose of logical IDs in CloudFormation).

Therefore, we decided construct names deserve an explicit and prominent place in our programming model and starting from this release, they have been promoted to the 2nd argument of all initializers.

```typescript
new MyConstruct(parent, name, props);
```

### New scheme for allocating CloudFormation logical IDs

In order to ensure uniqueness of logical IDs within a stack, we need to reflect the resource's full CDK path within it's logical ID. Prior to this release, logical IDs were a simple concatenation of the path components leading up to the resource. However, this could potentially create unresolvable conflicts ("a/b/c" == "ab/c").

Since logical IDs may only use alphanumeric characters and also restricted in length, we are unable to simply use a delimited path as the logical ID. Instead IDs are allocated by concatenating a human-friendly rendition from the path (components, de-duplicate, trim) with a short MD5 hash of the delimited path:

```
VPCPrivateSubnet2RouteTable0A19E10E
<-----------human---------><-hash->
```

One exception to this scheme is resources which are direct children of the `Stack`. Such resources will use their name as a logical ID (without the hash). This is done to support easier migration from existing CloudFormation templates.

### Renaming logical IDs to avoid destruction of resources

If you have CDK stacks deployed with persistent resources such as S3 buckets or DynamoDB tables, you may want to explicitly "rename" the new logical IDs to match your existing resources.

First, make sure you compare the newly synthesized template with any deployed stacks. `cdk diff` will tell you which resources will be destroyed if you deploy this update:

```
[-] Destroying MyTable (type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table)
[+] Creating MyTableCD117FA1 (type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table)
```

In order to avoid this, you can use `stack.renameLogical(from, to)` as follows. Note that `renameLogical` must be called **before** the resource is defined as logical IDs are allocated during initialization:

```typescript
// must be before defining the table (this instanceof Stack)
this.renameLogical('MyTableCD117FA1', 'MyTable');
new dynamodb.Table(this, 'MyTable', { /* .. */ });
```

Now, `cdk diff` should indicate no differences.

### All "props" types are now interfaces instead of classes

In order to improve the developer experience, we have changed the way we model construct "Props" and now they are defined as TypeScript interfaces. This has a few implications on how to use them:

In TypeScript, `new XxxProps()` won't work, you will have to simply assign an object literal:

```typescript
new Queue(this, 'MyQueue', { visibilityTimeoutSec: 300 });
```

In Java, you can create a concrete object using a builder:

```java
new Queue(this, "MyQueue", QueueProps.builder()
    .withVisibilityTimeout(300)
    .build());
```

### A design pattern for exporting/importing resources

All AWS constructs implement a common pattern which allows treating resources defined within the current stack and existing resources to be treated via a common interface:

For example, when defining a `Pipeline`, you can supply an artifacts bucket.

The bucket is defined within the same stack:

```typescript
const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'MyArtifactsBucket');
new Pipeline(this, 'MyCoolPipeline', { artifactsBucket: bucket });
```

You can also import a bucket by just specifying its name:

```typescript
const bucket = Bucket.import({ bucketName: new BucketName('my-bucket') });
new Pipeline(this, 'MyCoolPipeline', { artifactsBucket: bucket });
```

Or you can export the bucket from another stack and import it:

```typescript
// some other stack:
const bucket = new Bucket(otherStack, 'MyBucket');
const externalBucket = bucket.export();
// bucketRef contains tokens that allow you to pass it into `import`.

// my stack:
const importedBucket = Bucket.import(this, 'OtherArtifactsBucket', externalBucket);
new Pipeline(this, 'MyCoolPipeline', { artifactsBucket: importedBucket });
```

### Region-aware APIs for working with machine images (AMIs)

The **@aws-cdk/ec2** library exposes a new API for region-aware AMI discovery:

```typescript
const ami = new AmazonLinuxImage({
    edition: AmazonLinuxEdition.Standard, // default
    virtualization: AmazonLinuxVirt.HVM,  // default
    storage: AmazonLinuxStorage.EBS       // default is GeneralPurpose
});

new Fleet(this, 'MyAmazonLinuxFleet', { machineImage: ami, ... });
```

For Windows:

```typescript
const ami = new WindowsImage(WindowsVersion.WindowsServer2016EnglishNanoBase);
new Fleet(this, 'MyWindowsFleet', { machineImage: ami, ... });
```

Or, a mapping utility:

```typescript
const ami = new GenericLinuxImage({
    'us-east-1': 'ami-62bda218',
    'eu-west-1': 'ami-773acbcc'
});

new Fleet(this, 'MySuseFleet', { machineImage: ami, ... });
```

### A rich programming model for Code Suite services

The **@aws-cdk/codebuild**, **@aws-cdk/codecommit** and **@aws-cdk/codepipeline** construct libraries include rich APIs for defining continuous integration pipelines and builds.

The following code defines a pipeline with a CodeCommit source and CodeBuild build step. The pipeline is created with an artifacts bucket and a role, and least-privilege policy documents are automatically generated.

```typescript
// define a CodeCommit repository
const repo = new Repository(stack, 'MyRepo', { repositoryName: 'my-repo' });

// define a pipeline with two stages ("source" and "build")
const pipeline  = new Pipeline(stack, 'Pipeline');
const sourceStage = new Stage(pipeline, 'source');
const buildStage  = new Stage(pipeline, 'build');

// associate the source stage with the code commit repository
const source = new codecommit.PipelineSource(sourceStage, 'source', {
    artifactName: 'SourceArtifact',
    repository: repo,
});

// associate the build stage with code build project
new codebuild.PipelineBuildAction(buildStage, 'build', {
    project: new BuildProject(stack, 'MyBuildProject', { source: new CodePipelineSource() },
    source
});
```

### Inline JavaScript Lambda Functions

The **@aws-cdk/lambda** library includes an `InlineJavaScriptLambda` construct which makes it very easy to implement simple node.js Lambda functions with code inline in the CDK.

This CDK program defines an S3 Bucket and a Lambda function, and sets all the needed permissions. When the function is invoked, a file named 'myfile.txt' will be uploaded to the bucket with the text "Hello, world". The physical bucket name is passed through via the `BUCKET_NAME` environment variable.

```typescript
const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'MyBucket');

const lambda = new InlineJavaScriptLambda(this, 'MyLambda', {
    environment: {
        BUCKET_NAME: bucket.bucketName
    },
    handler: {
        fn: (event: any, context: any, callback: any) => {
            const s3 = new require('aws-sdk').S3();

            const req = {
                Bucket: process.env.BUCKET_NAME,
                Key: 'myfile.txt',
                Body: 'Hello, world'
            };

            return s3.upload(req, (err, data) => {
                if (err) return callback(err);
                console.log(data);
                return callback();
            });
        }
    }
});

// grant the Lambda execution role read/write permissions for the bucket
// this also adds a corresponding bucket resource policy
bucket.grantReadWrite(lambda.role);
```

### Resource and role IAM policies and grants

All AWS constructs now expose APIs for naturally adding statements to their resource or role policies. Constructs may have `addToRolePolicy(statement)` or `addToResourcePolicy(statement)` methods, which can be used to mutate the policies associated with a resource.

The `statement` is a `PolicyStatement` object with a rich API for producing IAM statements. This is an excerpt from the implementation of `topic.subscribeQueue`:

```typescript
queue.addToResourcePolicy(new PolicyStatement()
    .addResource(queue.queueArn)
    .addAction('sqs:SendMessage')
    .addServicePrincipal('sns.amazonaws.com')
    .setCondition('ArnEquals', { 'aws:SourceArn': this.topicArn }));
```

The S3 bucket construct has a set of "grant" methods (`grantRead`, `grantReadWrite`) which accept a principal resource (user, role or group) and an optional key prefix pattern and will render reciprocal IAM permissions, both in the principal's policy and the bucket policy:

```typescript
const reader = new User(this, 'Reader');
const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'MyBucket');
bucket.grantRead(reader);
```

Synthesizes to:

```yaml
Resources:
  ReaderF7BF189D:
    Type: AWS::IAM::User
  ReaderDefaultPolicy151F3818:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Policy
    Properties:

          Resource:
          - { "Fn::GetAtt": [ "MyBucketF68F3FF0", "Arn" ] }]
          - { "Fn::Join": [ "", [ { "Fn::GetAtt": [ "MyBucketF68F3FF0", "Arn" ] }, "/", "*" ] ] }
        Version: '2012-10-17'
```

### Security group connections framework

The **@aws-cdk/ec2** library includes a rich framework for modeling security group connections between resources such as a fleet, load balancers and databases.

For example, these automatically create appropriate ingress and egress rules in both security groups:

```typescript
// allow fleet1 top connect to fleet2 on port 80
fleet1.connections.allowTo(fleet2, new TcpPort(80), 'Allow between fleets');

// allow fleet3 to accept connections from a load balancer on ports 60000-65535
fleet3.connections.allowFrom(loadBalancer, new TcpPortRange(60000, 65535), 'Allow from load balancer');
```

### Improvements to attribute classes and tokens

- Remove the "Attribute" postfix from all generated attribute types. So now, it is `QueueArn` instead of `QueueArnAttribute`. "Attribute" postfix from attribute types
- Simplify the initialization of `Token` objects (all attribute types are Tokens). They can now be either initialized with a simple value or a lazy function. This means, that now you can write `new QueueArn('foo')`. This is useful when importing external resources into the stack.

### Improvements to the CDK Toolkit

The toolkit now outputs YAML instead of JSON by default.

Added active progress reporting for stack updates.

The diff output has been dramatically improved and provides a structure-aware diff. For example:

```
[~] Updating TableCD117FA1 (type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table)
        .ProvisionedThroughput:
            .WriteCapacityUnits: 10
    Creating MyQueueE6CA6235 (type: AWS::SQS::Queue)
```

### Library for unit and integration testing

The CDK is now shipped with a library called **@aws-cdk/assert** which aims to make it easy to write unit and integration tests for CDK libraries and apps. The library leverages the same powerful template diff mechanism used in the toolkit to print rich descriptions.

```typescript
import { expect } from '@aws-cdk/assert';

const stack = new Stack();
new Queue(stack, 'MyQueue', { visibilityTimeout: 300 });

expect(stack).to(haveResource('AWS::SQS::Queue', { VisibilityTimeout: 300 }));
expect(stack).to(countResources('AWS::SQS::Queue', 1));
expect(stack).toMatch({
    Resources: {
        MyQueue: {
            Type: 'AWS::SQS::Queue',
            Properties: {
                VisibilityTimeout: 300
            }
        }
    }
});
```

An initial integration testing utility is now available to allow users to implement manually executed CDK integration tests and ensure they are kept up-to-date if the code changes. This is an initial approach until we have a great way to automatically execute them during CI/CD.

### Updates to the IAM policy library

The APIs in the IAM policy library have been improved and now provide a richer and more strongly-typed experience.

A class hierarchy around `PolicyPrincipal` was created to reflect the various principals available: `AccountPrincipal`, `ServicePrincipal`, `ArnPrincipal`, `AccountRootPrincipal`.

The `Arn` type now has the ability to format and parse to/from its components:

```typescript
Arn.fromComponents({
    service: 'dynamodb',
    resource: 'table',
    account: '123456789012',
    region: 'us-east-1',
    partition: 'aws-cn',
    resourceName: 'mytable/stream/label'
});

// and
const bucketArn = Arn.parse('arn:aws:s3:::my_corporate_bucket')
// bucketArn === { partition: 'aws', service: 's3', resource: 'my_corporate_bucket' }
```

The `Permission` class was renamed to `PolicyStatement` and enriched with more strongly typed APIs.

### A new library for defining custom CloudFormation resources

A library to facilitate the definition of custom CloudFormation resources and exposing them as regular CDK constructs is now shipped with the CDK.

## 0.5.0 - 2018-03-29

### AWS Resource Constructs (L1)

- All CloudFormation resource constructs are now available from the **@aws-cdk/resources** package under their dedicated AWS service's namespace. we have been calling these resource constructs **Layer 1** (or "L1 constructs").
- All resource constructs now have the **Resource** suffix (**TableResource** instead of `Table`). This helps differentiate them from the rich AWS constructs we are also introducing in this release.
- The CloudFormation resource property "Name" is now called "xxxName" (where "xxx" is the name of the resource, like "queue") instead of "resourceName".
- Updated resources based on the latest CloudFormation resource specification.

Before:

```javascript
import { Pipeline } from '@aws-cdk/codepipeline';

new Pipeline(this, {
    resourceName: 'MyPipelineName'
});
```

After:

```javascript
import { codepipeline } from '@aws-cdk/resources';

new codepipeline.PipelineResource(this, {
    pipelineName: 'MyPipelineName'
});
```

### Framework

- Introducing **CDK Applets** which allow instantiating specific CDK stacks using a declarative YAML syntax.
- As a first step to enable diagnostics features in the toolkit, record logical ID (and stack trace) in metadata for stack elements.
- Introduce a new scheme for generating CloudFormation logical IDs which adds a hash of the construct path to the generated ID to avoid ID collisions. To opt-in for the new scheme, set `hashedLogicalIDs` to `true` when creating a **Stack**.
- Allow specifying explicit **logicalID** for stack elements like **Resource** **Parameter** and **Output**.
- `async exec()` changed to `run()` and `validate` was changed to be a synchronous method instead of async.
- Merged **@aws-cdk/core** into **aws-cdk**, which now where the core classes of the CDK framework live.
- The **Runtime Values** library, which was under **@aws-cdk/rtv** is now **@aws-cdk/rtv**.
- Bugfix: Tags could not be used because they failed validation.
- Bugfix: Allow "-" in stack names.

### Toolkit

- The toolkit is now called **CDK Toolkit** instead of "cx Toolkit". This means that the `cx` command-command line program is now called `cdk`.
- Added support **large CloudFormation templates** using a "toolkit stack" which contains an S3 bucket. This approach may be extended to provide other environment-related facilities in the future and requires that users "bootstrap" the toolkit stack into their environments. The current behavior will not require this stack unless you are trying to deploy a large template.
- It is now possible to **synthesize all stacks into a directory**.
- Allow using globs in `cdk deploy` to select multiple stacks.
- Default account ID lookup result is now cached.
- Better error messages.
- Improve deploy output.
- Bugfix: Better error message when the app has no stacks.
- Bugfix: Distinguish actual "stack missing" from "no credentials".
- Bugfix: Delete stack in unrecoverable state.
- Bugfix: Fix an issue where 'deploy' fails because subsequent invocations use the same argument array.
- Bugfix: prevent crash if ~/.aws/config doesn't exist.

### Documentation and Examples

- Implemented a few **advanced examples** These examples show how to use IAM policies, environmental context, template inclusion, nested stacks, resource references and using various CloudFormation semantics in the CDK

## 0.4.0 - 2018-03-05

### New Features

- **Environments** - this version extends the fidelity of a CDK deployment target from only _region_ to _region + account_, also referred to as an **_environment_**. This allows modeling complete apps that span multiple accounts/regions. To preserve the current behavior, if region/account is not specified, the CDK will default to the AWS SDK region/credential provider chain (`~/.aws/config`). We will add support for AWS SDK Profiles in a future release. See the **Environments** section of the CDK README for details).
- **Environmental Context** (such as availability zones and SSM parameters) - there are use-cases where CDK stacks need to consult with account and region-specific information when they are synthesized (we call this information "environmental context"). For example, the set of supported **availability zones** is specific to account _and_ region; the specific ID of certain public **AMIs** (Amazon Machine Image IDs) as published to the SSM parameter store is specific to each region. See the **Environmental Context** section in the CDK README for details .
- **Runtime Values** - a new mechanism for advertising values such as resource attributes and constants from construction-time to runtime code via the SSM parameter store. See the **Runtime Values** section in the CDK README for details.
- **Construct Validation** - it is now possible to implement a method `validate(): string[]` for any construct at any layer. Validation methods are all executed before a stack is synthesized and provide an opportunity for constructs to implement validation logic. See the **Construct Validation** section in the CDK README for details.
- **User-specific cx.json** - the toolkit will now incorporate settings from `~/.cx.json`. This allows users to supply user-specific settings. Note this file is applied _before_ the project-specific `cx.json` file is applied.
- **IAM Library Improvements** - allow creating IAM documents with a base document, a new class `AssumeRolePolicyDocument`, allow specifying multiple actions when creating a `Permission` ob object.
- **`stack.findResource(logicalId)`** - allows retriving a resource object from a stack based on it's calculated logical ID.
- **Windows AMIs are read from SSM parameter store**.

### Bug Fixes

- **cx Toolkit** returns a non-zero exit code when an error occurs.
- **Retain original names of CloudFormation properties** instead of auto-capitalizing based on heuristics, which caused some unexpected behavior in certain scenarios.
- **CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM** was added to "cx deploy" by default.

## 0.3.0 - 2018-01-30

### Highlights

- Java support:

```java
class HelloJavaStack extends Stack {
    public HelloJavaStack(final Construct parent, final StackProps props) {
        super(parent, props);

        VpcNetwork vpc = new VpcNetwork(this);

        new Fleet(this, new FleetProps()
                .withVpcSubnetwork(vpc.getPrivateSubnetwork())
                .withInstanceType(new InstanceType("t2.micro"))
                .withMachineImage(new WindowsMachineImage(0)));
    }
}
```

- **cx Toolkit** now supports standard AWS credentials.

- CloudFormation pseudo parameters and intrinsic functions are now implemented as normal classes (`AwsRegion`, `AwsStackId`, `FnConcat`) instead of static methods. We might introduce functional sugar at a later stage, but at the lower-level, we want to represent both intrinsic functions and pseudo parameters as classes so we can model their relationship more accurately. For example, all pseudo parameters extend `PseudoParameter`, all functions extends the `Fn`, all condition functions extend `FnCondition`, etc.

Before:

```javascript
Fn.if_(Fn.equals(param.ref, 'True'), 'Encrypted', Pseudo.NO_VALUE)
```

After:

```javascript
new FnIf(Fn.equals(param.ref, 'True'), 'Encrypted', new AwsNoValue())
```

- CloudFormation template options (`templateFormatVersion`, `description` and `transform`) are now grouped under `Stack.templateOptions` instead of directly under `Stack`.

Before:

```javascript
stack.description = 'This is my awesome template'
```

After:

```javascript
stack.templateOptions.description = 'This is my awesome template'
```

### Known Issues

- Stack names are limited to alphanumeric characters, so it won't be possible to set stack names to match existing deployed stacks. As a workaround you can use `cx --rename` to specify the actual stack name to use for `diff` or `deploy`. Thanks rmuller@ for reporting.
- When synthesizing templates, we transform all JSON keys to pascal case to conform with CloudFormation standards, but this also affects JSON blobs that are not CloudFormation such as IAM documents or environment variables.

### Non-breaking Changes

- Added support for **CloudFormation Rules**.
- **Cloud Executable Interface (CXI)**: changed semantics from "construct" to "synthesize" (backwards compatible).
- **Tokens**: improve error reporting when unable to resolve tokens.

## 0.2.0 - 2017-12-07

### Highlights

### Construct Names

- The initializer signature for constructs has changed and is now: `new Construct(parent[, props])`, where `props` is may include an _optional_ `name` property ("id" is now called "name").
- If `name` is not specified, the **type name** is used as the name. This will only be allowed when there is a single construct of a certain type under a parent.
- If a parent has more than a single child of the same type, all children must have an explicit names to avoid ambiguity when generating CloudFormation logical IDs.
- JSX support updated to use `name` instead of `id` when producing construct trees.

Before:

```javascript
new BeautifulConstruct(this, 'MyBeautifulConstruct', { ...props })
```

After:

```javascript
new BeautifulConstruct(this) // use defaults
new BeautifulConstruct(this, { ...props })
// or
new BeautifulConstruct(this, { name: 'MyBeautifulConstruct', ...props })
```

### Resource Attribute Types

- CloudFormation resource attribute properties now return a specialized type per attribute. For example, the `sqs.queueArn` property returns a `QueueArnAttribute` object instead of a `Token`.
- The `Attribute` and `ArnAttribute` classes extend `Token` and used as base classes for attribute types.
- Resource names are now added as a prefix to attribute properties (`queueArn` instead of `arn`). This is required for future support for duck-typing and polymorphic use of resources of multiple types via a single container.

Before:

```javascript
const t = new aws.dynamodb.Table(this);
assert(t.arn instanceof Token);
```

After:

```javascript
const t = new aws.dynamodb.Table(this);
assert(t.tableArn instanceOf TableArnAttribute);
assert(t.tableArn instanceOf ArnAttribute);
assert(t.tableArn instanceOf Token);
```

### Construct Metadata

- Constructs can now have **metadata** entries attached to them via `addMetadata(type,data)`.
- Each entry will also include the _stack trace_ from which the entry was added, which will later be used to improve the diagnosability of deployment errors.
- Stack metadata can be obtained using cx-Toolkit via `cx metadata`.
- `construct.addWarning(msg)` attaches a "warning" metadata entry to a construct, which is displayed as a warning when synthesizing or deploying the stack.
- cx-Toolkit will show warnings upon synthesis also supports `--strict` mode which will refuse to deploy stacks with warnings.

Example:

```javascript
const c = new Construct(this);
c.addWarning('this is a warning');
c.addMetadata('type', 'data');
```

```bash
$ cx metadata
{
  "/Stack/Construct": [
    {
      "type": "type",
      "data": "data",
      "trace": [ ... ]
    },
    {
      "type": "warning",
      "data": "this is a warning",
      "trace": [ ... ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
$ cx synth
Warning: this is a warning (at /Stack/Construct)
...
```

### Resource Enrichments

- Replaced `topic.subscribeToXxx` with `topic.subscribe(target)` where `target` is anything that adheres to the `SubscriptionTarget` interface (technically it's an abstract class because jsii doesn't support interfaces yet).
- Removed `function.addExecutionRole()` - an execution role is automatically created when invoking `function.addPermission(p)`.

### Tokens

- The `evaluate` method is now called `resolve`.

### CX Toolkit Usability Improvements

- If an app contains a single stack, no need to specify the stack name.
- `synth --interactive` (or `synth --interactive --verbose`) now displays real-time updates of a template's contents. Really nice for fast iteration;
- The toolkit now reads `cx.json` for default arguments. Very useful, for example, to remove the need to specify `--app` in every invocation.
