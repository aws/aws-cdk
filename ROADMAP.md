# AWS CDK Roadmap

> Updated 11/5/2024

The roadmap priorities for the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) are informed by what we hear from customers and interactions on Github, CDK.dev Slack, Stack Overflow, and Twitter. This document outlines the high level direction we are working towards, and for each project there is a tracking issue where you can leave feedback. We update this doc on a quarterly basis to reflect any changing priorities.

Follow [CDK Live!](https://www.youtube.com/@CDK-Live) and [cdk.dev](https://cdk.dev/) to learn what's new in AWS CDK.

Security and stability of the CDK is a top priority. If you think you‚Äôve found a potential security issue, please do not post it as an issue or a discussion thread in this repository. Instead, please follow the instructions [here](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/) or directly email [AWS security](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).

## Our Core Tenets (which guide prioritization decisions)

- **We empower CDK builders to innovate with confidence, without sacrificing security.** The CDK provides customers with conviction by providing a clear and streamlined direction to building secure, modernized, industry leading innovations with AWS.
- **Productivity through simplicity.** The CDK measurably improves developer productivity in building with AWS. We make Infrastructure as Code simple to define, understand, change, and troubleshoot.
- **Be transparent.** The AWS CDK team‚Äôs current work should be easily visible.
- **Listen to customers.** Allow them to participate in design decisions and to vote on and propose new AWS CDK features. We will periodically reprioritize the roadmap based on customer feedback.

## Themes

Over the course of the last few years, the CDK team has spent time speaking with and learning from its community. We've gathered that there were certain features that were greatly valued from the CDK and other features which would be beneficial to be added to its experience. We appreciate everyone sharing this feedback and we plan on addressing it through the targeted themes and RFCs listed below. Please be aware that the team will periodically work to add RFCs as we look to prioritize more work.

### L2 Abstractions

The CDK team is committed to supporting our existing library of AWS L2 abstractions. We continue to solicit community feedback on where additional L2 coverage makes it simpler and more efficient to build with AWS. Current L2s that the team‚Äôs working on are listed below. Please be aware that this list will update throughout the year. If you have feedback on other L2s that should be prioritized by our team, feel free to submit a separate RFC.

## Disclaimer

The AWS CDK team values feedback and guidance from its community of users, although final decisions on inclusion into the project will be made by AWS. We determine the high-level direction for our open roadmap based on customer feedback and popularity (üëçüèΩ and comments), security and operational impacts, and business value. Where features don‚Äôt meet our goals and longer-term strategy, we will communicate that clearly and openly as quickly as possible with an explanation of why the decision was made.

## FAQs

**Q: Why did you build an open roadmap?**
A: Your feedback and suggestions would help in ensuring that we are working on the most important and impactful issues. And if you are making decisions and plans based on what we are developing, this will provide insights on what is coming down the road for the CDK.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**
A: Because security and operational stability are our highest priorities, the above new features cannot be provided specific target dates. The roadmap is subject to change at any time, and roadmap issues in this repository do not guarantee a feature will be launched as proposed.

**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**
A: We will publish high-level direction that is within the scope of the CDK. Minor features and performance improvement tasks are not on the roadmap currently, but we are constantly trying to improve the roadmap so please leave your suggestions [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/3267).

**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**
A: When in doubt, please create an issue! Issues will be reviewed and/or forwarded appropriately. A great time to provide feedback is when the project is in Exploration, RFC stage, or when the feature is in beta release. As always, we listen to your feedback and adapt our plans if needed.

**Q: Can I üëçüèΩ existing issues?**
A: We strongly encourage you to do so, as it helps us understand which issues will have the widest impact. You can navigate to the issue details page and add a reaction (üëçüèΩ).

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**
A: We encourage you to open an issue, even if you‚Äôve requested it before via other channels. Issues submitted will be reviewed by the roadmap maintainers. If you find an issue already created for the feature, please upvote it (üëçüèΩ) and leave comments specific to your use case. To report a bug or create a small feature request, please [create an issue here](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/new/choose). If you are seeking to request a change in the CDK‚Äôs strategic direction or make a CDK core framework change, please [create a Request for Comments (RFC) ticket here](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/new/choose).

Please do not be discouraged if your ticket is closed‚Äîthat may happen if it is not a priority during the quarter it was submitted. The CDK team closes tickets in an effort to display what is prioritized at a given moment. If this happens, we invite you to try submitting it again later in the year.
