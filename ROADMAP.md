# AWS CDK Roadmap

> Updated 2/17/2025

The roadmap priorities for the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) are informed by what we hear from customers and interactions on Github, CDK.dev Slack, Stack Overflow, X, Bluesky, and any other place the community gathers and engages. This document outlines the high level direction we are working towards, and for each project there is a tracking issue where you can leave feedback. We update this doc on a quarterly basis to reflect any changing priorities. Please be aware that this list will update throughout the year and is subject to change. If you have feedback on items that should be prioritized by our team, feel free to submit a separate issue on GitHub.

Follow [cdk.dev](https://cdk.dev/) and [CDK Live!](https://www.youtube.com/@CDK-Live) to learn what's new in AWS CDK.

Security and stability of the CDK is a top priority. If you think you’ve found a potential security issue, please do not post it as an issue or a discussion thread in this repository. Instead, please follow the instructions [here](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/) or directly email [AWS security](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).

## Themes

In 2025, we will focus our efforts on: 1/ enhancing and expanding the CDK L2 construct library 2/ improving the CDK developer experience and 3/ supporting extensible infrastructure.

### Objective 1 - Enhance and expand the L2 construct library

Our vision is to provide L2 constructs for all AWS services, and timely maintain and enhance existing L2 constructs as their underlying services evolve. In 2025 we will continue to grow and maintain the L2 construct library, and in parallel develop additional tools and mechanisms to streamline L2 construct generation and maintenance. We’ll do this by: 1/ responding to community reported bugs and PRs, 2/ resolving top P1 feature requests for the most used L2 constructs, 3/ graduating five alpha constructs to GA, 4/ releasing three new, stable L2 constructs, and 5/ creating a generative AI-powered tool to enable the creation of new, stable L2 constructs with reduced engineering effort. We will also work to accelerate construct maintenance by creating mechanisms and tools to enable other AWS teams to create and maintain L2 constructs, and increase the adoption of 3rd party created and maintained L2 constructs by delivering improvements to Construct Hub, and mechanisms to increase community trust in such constructs.

For reference, below are the stages of a construct module lifecycle.

1. **Stage 0 - CFN Resources:** All construct library modules start in stage 0 when they are auto-generated from the CloudFormation resource specification. These are also referred to as CDK L1 constructs. 
2. **Stage 1 - Experimental:** The goal of the experimental stage is to iterate on the design and functionality of a construct library module with the freedom, and understanding of customers, to make breaking changes when desirable or necessary
3. **Stage 2 - Developer Preview:** The goal of developer preview is to deliver a release candidate with a stable API to conduct user acceptance testing and accumulate sufficient usage to declare a module is ready for general availability. We will only make breaking changes to developer preview modules when required to address unforeseen customer use cases or issues.
4. **Stage 3 - General Availability(GA):** The module is generally available with a backwards compatible guarantee across minor versions.

Kindly refer to the [construct module lifecyle](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/blob/main/text/0107-construct-library-module-lifecycle.md) for details on the different stages of a construct.

* **Service-led L2s:** Explore mechanism and tools to enable AWS service teams to create and maintain L2 constructs to support CDK to scale L2 support across all AWS services.

### Objective 2 - Continue to improve the CDK Developer Experience

Developers love CDK because it provides them with the ability to configure and manage their infrastructure using modern languages, IDEs, developer tools, and workflows. In 2025 we will address the most requested developer experience feature requirements by delivering: 1/ CDK upgrade tooling to help customers upgrade CDK applications , 2/ enhanced L1 constructs with support support for enums, resource interfaces, and CFN constraints, 3/ programmatic access to the CDK CLI toolkit, and 4/ CDK Stack refactoring and 5/ Give display names to assets. We will also explore enhanced troubleshooting capabilities, and developing tools to enable CDK users to leverage generative AI to create custom CDK constructs, and CDK applications.

**_Recent Releases_**

* **Upgrade from the AWS SDK v2 to v3:** The AWS SDK for JavaScript v2 is being deprecated. The CDK CLI has been migrated to [use AWS SDK for JS v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/29694)
* **Garbage Collection for Assets:** Assets which are uploaded to the CDK’s S3 bucket and ECR repository are never deleted, incurring costs. This [feature](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/64) provides the functionality to delete unused assets, saving costs for customers.

**_Work in progress_**

* **CDK CLI split:** - This [change](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/32775) supports decoupling the release cycles of the CDK CLI and the CDK Construct Library, allowing each to have its own cadence and versioning.
* **Programmatic access to the CDK CLI Toolkit:** This [feaeture](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/300) enable CDK users to programmatically trigger AWS CDK CLI commands, facilitating integration with existing tools and workflows. 
* **CDK Stack Refactoring:** This [feature](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/162) release will enable users to easily reorganize their constructs within the same or across different stacks.
* **CDK Upgrade tool:** An automated CDK upgrade tool that analyzes customer applications to identify outdated components, including deprecated constructs, properties, and features. The tool streamlines the upgrade process by providing targeted code modification suggestions and step-by-step migration guidance, enabling customers to modernize their CDK applications with reduced manual intervention and lower risk of deployment failures.

**_Work Planned_**
 
* **Give assets a display name:** This [feature](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/9628) allows specifying a display name for AWS CDK assets to improve clarity in asset publishing and deployment.
* **Enhanced L1 constructs:** This [rfc](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/pull/657) is a proposal to enhance the L1 constructs by adding support for enums, resource interfaces, and CFN contraints to generated L1s.
* **CLI: Enable client-side telemetry and analytics:** This [change]((https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/32010)) is to enable client-side telemetry and analytics collection in the CDK CLI.

**_Research Items_**

* **Generative CDK:** Enable CDK users to leverage AI models to generate CDK applications, and custom L2/3 constructs. This may include the ability to "generate/migrate from" other IaC or non-IaC to CDK, and visualize the generated CDK app/construct.
* **CDK Troubleshooting:** Improved troubleshooting through better traceability between CDK and CFN code.

### Objective 3 - Extensible infrastructure

These features allow CDK to grow beyond its initial scope and adapt to different infrastructure needs, while maintaining consistent patterns and practices.

**_Work in progress_**

* **Continued support for CDK8s library:** This roadmap item is to provide continued support to the CDK8s library, including resolving GitHub issues and reviewing Pull Requests (PRs). This addresses the open [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s/discussions/2052) on CDK8s maintenance state.

**_Research Items_**

* **Improved governance and compliance capabilities:** We'll explore developing a native policy-as-code features with pre-defined rule packs for common security guardrails (IAM policy restrictions, encryption requirements, public access controls) and enable custom rule-pack creation that integrates the CDK development lifecycle. This aims to provide Central IT teams better control and allows them to build guardrails to adhere to organizational best practices. 

* **Partner integrations** Explore partner opportunities to accelerate adoption of CDK by Terraform, Pulumi, and Open Tofu users through joint intiatives with partner organizations.

## Community Engagement

**Contributor Council Proposal Update:** We have completed phase one of the Contributor Council Charter (see [RFC #676](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/pull/679)), which focused on community input. During this period, we collected feedback from customers, maintainers, contributors, and the broader AWS CDK community. Our next step is to review these responses to finalize the council’s structure, processes, and next steps. Additional updates outside of this roadmap document will be shared as we transition into phase two.

## Disclaimer

The AWS CDK team values feedback and guidance from its community of users, although final decisions on inclusion into the project will be made by AWS. We determine the high-level direction for our open roadmap based on customer feedback and popularity (👍🏽 and comments), security and operational impacts, and business value. Where features don’t meet our goals and longer-term strategy, we will communicate that clearly and openly as quickly as possible with an explanation of why the decision was made.

## FAQs

**Q: Why did you build an open roadmap?**
A: Your feedback and suggestions would help in ensuring that we are working on the most important and impactful issues. And if you are making decisions and plans based on what we are developing, this will provide insights on what is coming down the road for the CDK.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**
A: Because security and operational stability are our highest priorities, the above new features cannot be provided specific target dates. The roadmap is subject to change at any time, and roadmap issues in this repository do not guarantee a feature will be launched as proposed.

**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**
A: We will publish high-level direction that is within the scope of the CDK. Minor features and performance improvement tasks are not on the roadmap currently, but we are constantly trying to improve the roadmap so please leave your suggestions [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/3267).

**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**
A: When in doubt, please create an issue! Issues will be reviewed and/or forwarded appropriately. A great time to provide feedback is when the project is in Exploration, RFC stage, or when the feature is in beta release. As always, we listen to your feedback and adapt our plans if needed.

**Q: Can I 👍🏽 existing issues?**
A: We strongly encourage you to do so, as it helps us understand which issues will have the widest impact. You can navigate to the issue details page and add a reaction (👍🏽).

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**
A: We encourage you to open an issue, even if you’ve requested it before via other channels. Issues submitted will be reviewed by the roadmap maintainers. If you find an issue already created for the feature, please upvote it (👍🏽) and leave comments specific to your use case. To report a bug or create a small feature request, please [create an issue here](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/new/choose). If you are seeking to request a change in the CDK’s strategic direction or make a CDK core framework change, please [create a Request for Comments (RFC) ticket here](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/new/choose).

Please do not be discouraged if your ticket is closed—that may happen if it is not a priority during the quarter it was submitted. The CDK team closes tickets in an effort to display what is prioritized at a given moment. If this happens, we invite you to try submitting it again later in the year.
