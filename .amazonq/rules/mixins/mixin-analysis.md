# Resource Mixin Analysis Steering Document

## Overview

This document provides guidance on how to analyze an AWS CDK resource to identify potential mixins that could be extracted as self-contained features. The goal is to improve modularity, maintainability, and extensibility of CDK resources by organizing related properties and functionality into cohesive mixins.

## What is a Mixin?

A mixin is a self-contained, reusable module that encapsulates a specific set of functionality which can be composed into a class. Unlike inheritance, mixins allow for more flexible composition by enabling a class to incorporate multiple feature sets without creating deep inheritance hierarchies. In the context of AWS CDK resources, mixins provide a way to add discrete capabilities to resources in a modular fashion.

## Analysis Process

Follow these steps to analyze a resource and identify potential mixins:

1. **Identify the Resource**: Determine which CDK resource you want to analyze (e.g., `s3.Bucket`, `lambda.Function`, etc.)

2. **Gather Resource Properties**:
   - Review the L2 construct properties (e.g., `BucketProps`)
   - Review the L1 construct properties (e.g., `CfnBucketProps`)
   - Examine the implementation of the resource class

3. **Group Related Properties**: Organize properties into logical groups based on functionality
   - Look for properties that work together to implement a specific feature
   - Consider how AWS services organize their features in the console and documentation

4. **Define Mixins**: For each group of related properties, define a potential mixin
   - Give the mixin a descriptive name (e.g., "Encryption Mixin")
   - List the key capabilities the mixin provides
   - Document the relevant L2 properties
   - Document the relevant L1 properties

5. **Identify Missing High-Level Properties**: For each mixin, check if there are L1 properties without corresponding L2 properties
   - Design appropriate high-level interfaces for these properties
   - **AVOID L1 Pass-Through**: Do not create interfaces that simply expose L1 CloudFormation properties directly
   - Create meaningful abstractions that provide developer-friendly APIs with sensible defaults
   - Document suggested interfaces with TypeScript definitions

6. **Ensure most L1 and L2 properties are used**: For any props not Covered by Mixins go back and check if there could be a mixin created for them
   - Check if it makes sense to create a mixin for them
   - Execute step 4: Define Mixins for the uncovered props

## Document Structure

Create a markdown document named `resource-v2.md` (e.g., `bucket-v2.md`) with the following structure:

# Resource Mixins Analysis

## What is a Mixin?

[Standard explanation of mixins and their benefits]

Based on analysis of the [ResourceName] class in `resource.ts`, the following mixins could be extracted as self-contained features:

## 1. [Mixin Name]

- [Key capability 1]
- [Key capability 2]
- [Key capability 3]

**Relevant [ResourceName]Props:**

- `property1`: Type - Description
- `property2`: Type - Description

**Relevant Cfn[ResourceName]Props:**

- `property1`: Type - Description
- `property2`: Type - Description

[If applicable, include suggested interfaces for missing high-level properties:]

**Suggested Interface:**

```typescript
/**
 * [Interface description]
 */
export interface SuggestedInterface {
  /**
   * [Property description]
   */
  readonly property1: string;
  
  /**
   * [Property description]
   * @default - [Default value description]
   */
  readonly property2?: number;
}
```

**Important**: Avoid creating interfaces that are simple pass-throughs of L1 CloudFormation properties. Instead, create meaningful abstractions that:
- Use CDK constructs (e.g., `IBucket`, `IRole`) instead of raw CloudFormation references
- Provide sensible defaults and simplified configuration options
- Group related L1 properties into logical high-level concepts
- Offer developer-friendly property names and documentation

## [ResourceName]Props Not Covered by Mixins

- `property`: Type - Description

## Cfn[ResourceName]Props Not Covered by Mixins

- `property`: Type - Description
~~~

## Document location

Unless told otherwise, write the Mixins Analysis document into the service folder, named as `resource-mixins.md`.
E.g. for EC2 instance, the location would be `packages/aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2/instance-mixins.md`.

## Example Mixins

Common mixins found in many AWS resources include:

1. **Encryption Mixin**: Handles resource encryption configuration
2. **Logging Mixin**: Manages logging settings
3. **Monitoring Mixin**: Configures metrics and alarms
4. **Networking Mixin**: Handles VPC, subnet, and security group settings
5. **Tagging Mixin**: Manages resource tags
6. **Permissions Mixin**: Controls IAM permissions and resource policies
7. **Lifecycle Mixin**: Manages resource lifecycle (creation, updates, deletion)

## Interface Design Guidelines

When designing mixin interfaces, follow these principles:

1. **Avoid L1 Pass-Through**: Never create interfaces that simply expose L1 CloudFormation properties without abstraction
2. **Use CDK Constructs**: Prefer CDK interfaces (e.g., `IBucket`, `IRole`) over raw CloudFormation types
3. **Provide Meaningful Defaults**: Include `@default` documentation for optional properties
4. **Group Related Concepts**: Combine related L1 properties into logical high-level structures
5. **Developer-Friendly Names**: Use intuitive property names that match AWS console terminology
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide clear descriptions of what each property controls

## Benefits of Mixin Analysis

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Grouping related properties makes the code more maintainable
2. **Better Developer Experience**: Clearer separation of concerns makes the API easier to understand
3. **Enhanced Extensibility**: New features can be added as mixins without disrupting existing code
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Similar features across different resources can follow consistent patterns
5. **Simplified Testing**: Mixins can be tested in isolation
6. **Meaningful Abstractions**: High-level interfaces hide CloudFormation complexity
