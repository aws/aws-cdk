The **AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)** is an open-source software development
framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using
the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK’s library of
infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your
infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

The CDK is available in the following languages:

* JavaScript, TypeScript ([Node.js ≥ 10.13.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/))
  - We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
  - ⚠️ versions `13.0.0` to `13.6.0` are not supported due to compatibility issues with our dependencies.
* Python ([Python ≥ 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Java ([Java ≥ 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven ≥ 3.5.4](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))
* .NET ([.NET Core ≥ 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))

-------

Developers use the [CDK framework] in one of the
supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components called [constructs], which
are composed together into [stacks], forming a "CDK app".

They then use the [AWS CDK CLI] to interact with their CDK app. The CLI allows developers to
synthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation Templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts and "diff"
against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change.

The [AWS Construct Library] includes a module for each
AWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of
how to use AWS. The AWS Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and
glue-logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals
on AWS.

Modules in the AWS Construct Library are designated Experimental while we build
them; experimental modules may have breaking API changes in any release.  After
a module is designated Stable, it adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/),
and only major releases can have breaking changes. Each module's stability designation
is available on its Overview page in the [AWS CDK API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html).
For more information, see [Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/reference.html#versioning)
in the CDK Developer Guide.

## Getting Started

For a detailed walkthrough, see the [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#hello_world_tutorial) in the AWS CDK [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).

### At a glance
Install or update the [AWS CDK CLI] from npm (requires [Node.js ≥ 10.13.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/)). We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
⚠️ versions `13.0.0` to `13.6.0` are not supported due to compatibility issues with our dependencies.

```console
$ npm i -g aws-cdk
```

(See [Manual Installation](./MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md) for installing the CDK from a signed .zip file).

Initialize a project:

```console
$ mkdir hello-cdk
$ cd hello-cdk
$ cdk init sample-app --language=typescript
```

This creates a sample project looking like this:

```ts
export class HelloCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'HelloCdkQueue', {
      visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)
    });

    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'HelloCdkTopic');

    topic.addSubscription(new subs.SqsSubscription(queue));
  }
}
```

Deploy this to your account:

```console
$ cdk deploy
```

Use the `cdk` command-line toolkit to interact with your project:

 * `cdk deploy`: deploys your app into an AWS account
 * `cdk synth`: synthesizes an AWS CloudFormation template for your app
 * `cdk diff`: compares your app with the deployed stack

## Getting Help

The best way to interact with our team is through GitHub. You can open an [issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/new/choose) and choose from one of our templates for bug reports, feature requests, documentation issues, or guidance.

If you have a support plan with AWS Support, you can also create a new [support case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).

You may also find help on these community resources:
* Look through the [API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html) or [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide)
* The #aws-cdk Slack channel in [cdk.dev](https://cdk.dev)
* Ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-cdk)
  and tag it with `aws-cdk`

### Roadmap

The [AWS CDK Roadmap project board](https://github.com/orgs/aws/projects/7) lets developers know about our upcoming features and priorities to help them plan how to best leverage the CDK and identify opportunities to contribute to the project. See [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) for more information and FAQs.
