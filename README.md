![Build Status](https://codebuild.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/badges?uuid=eyJlbmNyeXB0ZWREYXRhIjoiRUlEQk1UWVhQRDduSy9iWWtpa012bmJSU0t2aXpCeEtTT2VpWDhlVmxldVU0ZXBoSzRpdTk1cGNNTThUaUtYVU5BMVZnd1ZhT2FTMWZjNkZ0RE5hSlpNPSIsIml2UGFyYW1ldGVyU3BlYyI6IllIUjJNUEZKY3NqYnR6S3EiLCJtYXRlcmlhbFNldFNlcmlhbCI6MX0%3D&branch=master)

The **AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)** is an infrastructure modeling framework that allows you to define your cloud resources using an imperative programming interface. The CDK is currently in developer preview. We look forward to community feedback and collaboration.

Developers can use one of the supported programming languages to define
reusable cloud components called **constructs**, which are composed
together to form **Apps**. Apps are synthesized to AWS
CloudFormation Templates and deployed to the AWS Cloud using the **CDK
Command Line Toolkit**.

The CDK is shipped with a rich library of constructs called the **AWS
Construct Library**, which includes constructs for all AWS services.

You will end up writing code that looks like this:

```ts
const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'MyQueue', {
    visibilityTimeoutSec: 300
});

const topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'MyTopic');

topic.subscribeQueue(queue);
```

The following screencast shows the experience of installing and working with the CDK:
