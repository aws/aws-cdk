The **AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)** is an open-source software development
framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using
the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK’s library of
infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your
infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

The CDK is available in the following languages:

* JavaScript, TypeScript ([Node.js ≥ 10.13.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/))
* Python ([Python ≥ 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Java ([Java ≥ 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven ≥ 3.5.4](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))
* .NET ([.NET Core ≥ 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))

Developers use the [CDK framework] in one of the
supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components called [constructs], which
are composed together into [stacks], forming a "CDK app".

They then use the [AWS CDK CLI] to interact with their CDK app. The CLI allows developers to
synthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation Templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts and "diff"
against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change.

The [AWS Construct Library] includes a module for each
AWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of
how to use AWS. The AWS Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and
glue-logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals
on AWS.

## At a glance

Install or update the [AWS CDK CLI] from npm (requires [Node.js ≥ 10.13.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/)):

```bash
$ npm i -g aws-cdk
```

(See [Manual Installation](./MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md) for installing the CDK from a signed .zip file).

Initialize a project:

```bash
$ mkdir hello-cdk
$ cd hello-cdk
$ cdk init sample-app --language=typescript
```

This creates a sample project looking like this:

```ts
export class HelloCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'HelloCdkQueue', {
      visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)
    });

    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'HelloCdkTopic');

    topic.addSubscription(new subs.SqsSubscription(queue));
  }
}
```

Deploy this to your account:

```bash
$ cdk deploy
```

Use the `cdk` command-line toolkit to interact with your project:

 * `cdk deploy`: deploys your app into an AWS account
 * `cdk synth`: synthesizes an AWS CloudFormation template for your app
 * `cdk diff`: compares your app with the deployed stack

For a detailed walkthrough, see the [tutorial] in the AWS CDK [Developer Guide].
