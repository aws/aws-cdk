# AWS CDK GitHub Actions

These workflows and actions are configured in the AWS CDK GitHub repository.

## Pull Request Triggered

### Auto Approve

`auto-approve` label.
Owner: Core CDK team

### PR Linter Trigger

[pr-linter-trigger.yml](pr-linter-trigger.yml): A workflow triggered by `pull_request_review`
that uploads necessary information about the pull request and then triggers the
[pr-linter](pr-linter.yml). Necessary because the `pull_request_review` trigger runs actions
on the merge branch not the base branch (with its secrets).
