  # Check for the presence of a PROJEN_GITHUB_TOKEN secret.
  #
  # This is expected to contain a personal access token of someone who has
  # permissions to bypass branch protection rules.
  #
  # If not present, we can only use GitHub Actions Token permissions,
  # but this has the following downsides:
  #
  # - Those are bound by branch protection rules (so automated pushing won't work).
  # - As soon as a workflow file needs to be changed, GitHub will reject the push.
  #   Only Apps and Users can be allowed to modify workflows.
