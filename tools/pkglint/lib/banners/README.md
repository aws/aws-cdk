README maturity banners.

L1 banners will only be included if the package contains a
`lib/*.generated.ts` file.

L2 banners will be included if the package contains a non-generated,
non-index ts file.

Some banners files are the same, or empty on purpose, because the messaging
is designed to be combined between the L1 and L2 layers.
