You can use this tool to help create bundled packages with minimal dependencies and appropriate license attributions.

## Why

When shipping nodejs applications, there is currently no easy way to ensure your users are
consuming the exact dependency closure your package was tested against.

This is because many libraries define their dependencies with a range, rather than a fixed version.
NPM has provided an install time lock file called [shrinkwrap](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-shrinkwrap)
to help mitigate this, however, this file is only respected by NPM itself, and not by other package managers such as Yarn.

## What

This package wires up several popular tools to offer a simpler entrypoint for
creating self-contained nodejs packages.

The resulting packages are still npm installable packages, but you can use this tool to
replace the entrypoints you specify with a bundled version of them, embedding their dependencies inline.
Note that embedding dependencies means you are effectively redistributing third-party software.
This could have licensing implications, and it is your responsibility to provide proper
and typically requires proper attribution of the bundled dependencies,
while validating their licenses allow such redistribution.

You can use this tool to help achieve the following tasks:

- Bundle the entrypoints inside the package.

  > Currently done with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), but is subject to change.

- Validate and create THIRD_PARTY_LICENCES file with third-party attributions for packages with declared licensing information.

  > Currently done with [license-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker), but is subject to change.

- Detect circular imports that are exhibited in your package, or in your dependency closure.

  > Currently done with [madge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/madge), but is subject to change.
  > This is necessary because circular imports mess up the declaration order of types in the bundled file.

### Disclaimer

Features of this package rely on the dependencies' declared licensing information, and the fulsomeness of
the generated attribution is dependent on the dependenciesâ€™ declarations.
This tool is not a substitute for your code attribution processes, but you can use it to help
streamline attribution items for dependencies that have license declarations.
The user of this package remains responsible for complying to their dependencies' licensing requirements,
including any attribution obligations.

We strongly recommend that you check all of your code into source control, and follow your ordinary code attribution processes.

## Alternative Approaches

We considered two other alternatives before eventually going down this route:

### Bundled Dependencies

Aside from a shrinkwrap file, NPM also offers a feature called `bundledDependencies`
to vendor in your dependencies inside the `node_modules` directory of your package.

> See [bundledDependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#bundleddependencies)

While this approach seems to be supported across all package managers, that won't be
the case for Yarn 2.x and above, or more concretely,
for the [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) feature.

### Static Binaries

Another option would have been to produce platform specific static binaries that embed both
dependencies as well as a node runtime.

This approach is valid, but really depends on the use case. For example if you need your package
to still be installable by npm, it doesn't really fit. Also, it's not relevant for libraries,
only CLI applications.

## How

Run the tool from the root directory of your package.

```console
$ node-bundle --help
Usage: node-bundle COMMAND

Commands:
  node-bundle validate  Validate the package is ready for bundling
  node-bundle write     Write the bundled version of the project to a temp
                        directory
  node-bundle pack      Write the bundle and create the tarball

Options:
  --entrypoint       List of entrypoints to bundle                       [array]
  --external         Packages in this list will be excluded from the bundle and
                     added as dependencies (example: fsevents:optional)
                                                           [array] [default: []]
  --allowed-license  List of valid licenses                [array] [default: []]
  --resource         List of resources that need to be explicitly copied to the
                     bundle (example:
                     node_modules/proxy-agent/contextify.js:bin/contextify.js)
                                                           [array] [default: []]
  --dont-attribute   Dependencies matching this regular expressions wont be
                     added to the notice file                           [string]
  --test             Validation command to sanity test the bundle after its
                     created                                            [string]
  --help             Show help                                         [boolean]
  --version          Show version number                               [boolean]
```

You can also use the programmatic access:

```ts
import { Bundle } from '@aws-cdk/node-bundle';

const bundle = new Bundle({
  packageDir: process.cwd(),
  allowedLicenses: ['Apache-2.0', 'MIT'],
});

bundle.pack();
```

### Integrate with your build process

We recommend to integrate this tool in the following way:

1. Add a `node-bundle validate` command as a post compile step.
2. Set your packaging command to `node-bundle pack`.

This way, you can validate local dev builds not to break any functionality needed for bundling.
In addition, developers can run `node-bundle validate --fix` to automatically fix any (fixable) violations
and commit that to source control.

For example, if a dependency is added but the attribution file has not been re-generated,
you can use `node-bundle validate` to catch this, and regenerate it with `node-bundle validate --fix`.

## Take into account

By default, the tool will use the `main` directive of the `package.json` as
the entrypoint. This will help you ensure that all top level exports of the
package are preserved.

Deep imports such as `const plugins = require('your-package/lib/plugins')` are considered
private and should not be used by your consumers. However, if you absolutely have to
preserve those as well, you should pass custom multiple entry-points for each deep import.
Note that this will balloon up the package size significantly.

If you are bundling a CLI application that also has top level exports, we suggest to extract
the CLI functionality into a function, and add this function as an export to `index.js`.
