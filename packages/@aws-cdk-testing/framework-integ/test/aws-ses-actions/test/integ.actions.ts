/**
 * 1. Create a free Workmail test domain (https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/v2/home?region=us-east-1#/organizations/create)
 *  - It should automatically be added to your list of verified SES domains, no need to exit the SES sandbox
 * 2. Add a new user email address in the Workmail console
 * 3. Remove the automatically created INBOUND_MAIL rule set (https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-east-1#/email-receiving/INBOUND_MAIL)
 * 4. Update the TEST_* constants declared below with the organization details and email address you created
 * 5. Deploy the stack with --no-clean
 * 6. Set the rule set as active in the SES web console (https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-east-1#/email-receiving)
 * 7. Send an email to the email address you created
 * 8. Check the following:
 *  - The email should be in the WorkMail user inbox
 *  - The email should be saved to the S3 bucket
 *  - The SQS queue should receive 6 receipt notifications
 *  - A bounce notification should be sent back to the sender mailbox
