This [PR](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/16205) added a node version check to our CLI courtesy of [`@jsii/check-node/run`](https://github.com/aws/jsii/tree/main/packages/%40jsii/check-node).

This check now causes the CLI to print a deprecation warning that changes the output of the `synth` command. We don't consider this a breaking change since we have no guarantess for CLI output, but it did break some our integ tests (namely `cdk synth`) that used to rely on a specific output.

This patch brings the [fix](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/16216) into the regression suite.
