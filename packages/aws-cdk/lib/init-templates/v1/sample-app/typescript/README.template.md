# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`%name.PascalCased%Stack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Tutorial

* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
