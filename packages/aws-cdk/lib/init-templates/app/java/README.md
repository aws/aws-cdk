Welcome to your CDK Java project!

It is a Maven-based project, so you can open this directory with any Maven-compatible Java IDE,
and you should be able to build and run tests from your IDE.

You should explore the contents of this template. It demonstrates a CDK app with two instances of
a stack (`HelloStack`) which also uses a user-defined construct (`HelloConstruct`).

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. This example relies on maven
to do that.

# Useful commands

 * `mvn package`     compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
