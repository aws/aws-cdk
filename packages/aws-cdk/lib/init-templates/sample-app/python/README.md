# Welcome to your CDK Python project!

You should explore the contents of this template. It demonstrates a CDK app with two instances of
a stack (`HelloStack`) which also uses a user-defined construct (`HelloConstruct`).

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization process also creates
a virtualenv within this project, stored under the .env directory.

After the init process completes, you can use the following steps to get your project set up.

```
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py develop
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

You can now begin exploring the source code, contained in the hello directory.
There is also a very trivial test included that can be run like this:

```
$ pytest
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add to
your requirements.txt file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

# Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
