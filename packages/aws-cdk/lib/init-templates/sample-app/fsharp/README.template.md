# Welcome to your CDK F# project!

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`%name.PascalCased%Stack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It uses the [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/) to compile and execute your project.

## Useful commands

* `dotnet build src` compile this app
* `cdk ls`           list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`        emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`       deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`         compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`         open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
