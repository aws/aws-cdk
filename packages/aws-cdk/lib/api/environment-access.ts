   *
   *  2. The lookup role may not have the correct permissions (for example, ReadOnlyAccess was added in
   *     bootstrap stack version 8); the stack will have a minimum version number on it.
   *     a. If it does not we throw an error which should be handled in the calling
   *        function (and fallback to use a different role, etc)
   *
   * Upon success, caller will have an SDK for the right account, which may or may not have
