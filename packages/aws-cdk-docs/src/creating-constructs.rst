Creating |cdk| Constructs
#########################

This topic provides information on how to create constructs in the |cdk|.

.. _what_are_constructs:

What Are Constructs?
====================

As described in :doc:`concepts`, constructs are components that developers can
combine into other constructs and an application stack to create an |cdk|
application.

The lowest-level |cdk| construct is a Resource Construct, which represents a
single AWS service resource, such as an SNS topic or an SQS queue.

The next level of constructs, which we call a Construct Library Construct,
typicall wraps one or more Resource Constructs and adds higher-level
abstractions. These can include:

* Convenient defaults.
* Automatic creation of related resources such as policy documents, IAM roles or encryption keys.
* Methods to make the resource interact with other resources.

For example, the stack described in the :doc:`getting-started` topic consists of
an |SQS| queue, |SNS| topic, a subscription between the topic and the queue, and
an |IAM| policy document.

The |cdk| includes a variety of Library constructs, and you can create your own
for special needs. You might even consider writing and publishing purpose-built
constructs (:ref:`purpose_built_constructs`) to solve common business needs. Be
sure to have a look at the :ref:`guidelines` section on tips for developing
new constructs.

Whether you're planning to write a purpose-built construct for your own
application or submit a new Construct Library construct to the CDK, the process
is quite similar. It's described below:

.. _creating_l2_constructs:

Creating Construct Library constructs
=====================================

To create a new Construct Library construct as a pull request to the |cdk|:

* Fork the |cdk| project to your own GitHub account.
* Clone the repository to your computer:

.. code-block:: sh

   mkdir ~/cdk
   cd ~/cdk
   git clone ...

* Create a new branch to hold your code

.. code-block:: sh

   git checkout my-branch

* Create a new folder, *aws-cdk-RESOURCE*, in *packages/*,
  where *RESOURCE* is the name of a |cfn| resource.

* Code goes in *lib/*; tests in *test/*.

* Create an *index.ts* file that only imports the other *NAME.ts* files,
  where *NAME* indicates the functionality within the file.

* Create *NAME.ts* for each set of related classes,
  such as the construct itself and its props interface.

In *NAME.ts*:

* Create a class.

* Create the related props interface.

* Instantiate the resource.

* Add enhancements as methods.

* Set props to reasonable default values
  (think clicking through the console and accepting those defaults).

* Don't forget to implement **validate()**.

Finally for the package:

* Add a test, *test.NAME.ts*, for each construct.

* Create an integration test, *integ.everything.ts*.

* Commit your changes and push them back to GitHub.

* Once everything looks good, navigate to the |cdk| project on the GitHub
  website, select your branch, and next to the **Branch** menu select **New pull
  request**.

See the **aws-cdk-dynamodb** package for examples.

Validation
----------

Validation happens in one of two places:

* In the constructor, to validate the properties that are passed in.
* If the Construct offers methods that mutate the state of the Construct,
  in the Construct's :py:meth:`aws-cdk.Construct.validate` method. This
  method is called by the framework after the Construct hierarchy has been set up,
  and is expected to return a list of validation error messages.

Construct implementors should prefer throwing validation errors in the constructor,
falling back to overriding the :py:meth:`aws-cdk.Construct.validate` method
only if the Construct offers mutating members.

Example of implementing validate:

.. code-block:: js

    class MyConstruct extends Construct {
      public validate() {
        if (this.getChildren().length > 1) {
          return [ 'this construct can only have a single child' ];
        }
        else {
          return [ ];
        }
      }
    }
