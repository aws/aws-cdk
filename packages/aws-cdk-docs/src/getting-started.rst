Getting Started With the |cdk|
##############################

This topic provides information for those getting started with the |cdk-long| (|cdk|).

.. _hello_cdk:

Hello, CDK!
===========

Let's use the |cdk| to create an |CFN| an |SQS| queue, an |SNS| topic, a subscription between the topic and the queue,
and an |IAM| policy document that enables the
topic to send messages to the queue.

.. _hello_cdk_typescript

.. _create_dirs:

Create Your Project Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use **cdk init --lang** *LANGUAGE* to create a skeleton for your |cdk| project
in one of the supported programming languages.
For the examples in this section we'll use TypeScript.

.. code-block:: sh

   mkdir hello-cdk
   cd hello-cdk
   cdk init --language=typescript

The **cdk init** command creates a skeleton |cdk| program for you to work with
and displays some useful commands to help you get started.

.. note:: You can use an IDE, such as
   `Microsoft Visual Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_,
   `Sublime Text <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`_ with the
   `Sublime TypeScript <https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin>`_ plugin, or
   `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_ with the
   `Atom TypeScript <https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript>`_ plugin,
   to get auto-completion in your Typescript code.

Replace the contents of the file *index.ts* with the following code to create a class that
extends **Stack**, and include some construction logic.

.. code-block:: js

    // You'll need this statement in every app
    import { App, Stack, StackProps } from '@aws-cdk/core';

    // The SNS resources, such as Topic, are defined in aws-cdk-sns
    import { Topic } from '@aws-cdk/sns';

    // The SQS resources, such as Queue, are defined in aws-cdk-sqs
    import { Queue } from '@aws-cdk/sqs';

    class HelloStack extends Stack {
        // Instantiate HelloStack with a reference to its parent,
        // as it might need some context from the app;
        // a name; and some optional properties.
        // You'll almost always use these same two lines.
        constructor(parent: App, name: string, props?: StackProps) {
            super(parent, name, props);

	    // Create an SNS topic
            const topic = new Topic(this, 'MyTopic');

	    // Create an SQS queue
            const queue = new Queue(this, 'MyQueue', {
                // By default you only get 30 seconds to delete a read message after you've read it;
                // otherwise it becomes available to other consumers.
                // This extends that duration to 5 minutes.
                visibilityTimeoutSec: 300
            });

            // Subscribe the topic to the queue
            topic.subscribeQueue(queue);
        }
    }

    // Create a new App and associate the HelloStack stack with it.
    const app = new App(process.argv);
    new HelloStack(app, 'hello-cdk');

    // Boilerplate to produce the CloudFormation template
    process.stdout.write(app.run());

.. _compile:

Compiling the App
-----------------

Use one of the commands in the following table to compile your app.
You must compile your app every time you change it.

.. list-table::
  :widths: 1 2
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Language
    - Compilation Command

  * - TypeScript
    - `npm run prepare`
      (use `npm run watch` in a separate command window to watch for source changes and automatically recompile)

.. _create_cloud_formation:

Synthesizing a CloudFormation Template
--------------------------------------

Use the **cdk synth** command to synthesize a |CFN| template for a stack in your app.
You do not need to synthesize your |CFN| template to deploy it.

.. code-block:: console

   cdk synth

You should see output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    Resources:
        MyTopic86869434:
            Type: 'AWS::SNS::Topic'
        MyTopicTopicToQueue2F98E5BA:
            Type: 'AWS::SNS::Subscription'
            Properties:
                Endpoint:
                    'Fn::GetAtt':
                        - MyQueueE6CA6235
                        - Arn
                Protocol: sqs
                TopicArn:
                    Ref: MyTopic86869434
        MyQueueE6CA6235:
            Type: 'AWS::SQS::Queue'
	    Properties:
                VisibilityTimeout: 300
        MyQueuePolicy6BBEDDAC:
            Type: 'AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy'
            Properties:
                PolicyDocument:
                    Statement:
                        -
                            Action: 'sqs:SendMessage'
                            Condition:
                                ArnEquals:
                                    'aws:SourceArn':
                                        Ref: MyTopic86869434
                            Effect: Allow
                            Principal:
                                Service: sns.amazonaws.com
                            Resource:
                                'Fn::GetAtt':
                                    - MyQueueE6CA6235
                                    - Arn
                    Version: '2012-10-17'
                Queues:
                    -
                        Ref: MyQueueE6CA6235


As you can see, the call to :py:meth:`_aws-cdk_sns.TopicRef.subscribeQueue` on
the :py:class:`_aws-cdk_sns.Topic` resulted in:

1. Creating an **AWS::SNS::Subscription** associated with the queue and the topic.
2. Adding a statement to the **AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy**, which allows the topic to send messages to the queue.

.. _deploy_your_stack:

Deploying Your Stack
---------------------

Use **cdk deploy** to deploy the stack. As **cdk deploy** executes you
should see information messages, such as feedback from CloudFormation logs.

.. code-block:: sh

   cdk deploy

.. note:: You must specify your default credentials and region to use the **cdk deploy** command.

   Use the `AWS Command Line Interface <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html>`_
   ``aws configure`` command to specify your default credentials and region.
   
   Important: make sure that you explicitly specify a **region**.

   You can also set environment variables for your default credentials and region.
   Environment variables take precedence over settings in the credentials or config file.

   * *AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID* specifies your access key
   * *AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY* specifies your secret access key
   * *AWS_DEFAULT_REGION* specifies your default region

   See `Environment Variables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html>`_
   in the CLI User Guide for details.

.. _making_changes:

Making Changes
--------------

Let's change the visibility timeout of the queue from 300 to 500.

.. code-block:: javascript

    const queue = new Queue(this, 'MyQueue', {
        visibilityTimeoutSec: 500
    });

Run the following command to see the difference between the *deployed* stack and your |cdk| project
(if you haven't deployed the stack, you won't see any output):

.. code-block:: sh

    # compile your code (depends on your language)
    cdk diff

You should see something like the following.

.. code-block:: sh

    [~] ðŸ›  Updating MyQueueE6CA6235 (type: AWS::SQS::Queue)
     â””â”€ [+] .VisibilityTimeout:
         â”œ  Old value: 300
         â””â”€ New value: 500

If the changes are acceptable, use **cdk deploy** to update your
infrastructure.
