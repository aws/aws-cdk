Welcome to the |cdk-long| (|cdk|) User Guide.
The |cdk| is a software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code.
It consists of a core framework library,
which implements the basic programming model;
a command-line toolkit;
and a set of AWS-vended class libraries for defining AWS resources
using rich object-oriented APIs.

Here's a short example of creating an |SNS| topic, an |SQS| queue,
and subscribing the topic to the queue.
We'll explain the code in more detail,
including how to see your |CFN| template before you deploy it,
in :doc:`getting-started`.

.. code-block:: js

    import { App, Stack, StackProps } from '@aws-cdk/core';
    import { Topic } from '@aws-cdk/sns';
    import { Queue } from '@aws-cdk/sqs';

    class HelloStack extends Stack {
        constructor(parent: App, name: string, props?: StackProps) {
            super(parent, name, props);

            const topic = new Topic(this, 'MyTopic');

            const queue = new Queue(this, 'MyQueue', {
                visibilityTimeoutSec: 300
            });

            topic.subscribeQueue('TopicToQueue', queue);
        }
    }

    const app = new App(process.argv);
    new HelloStack(app, 'hello-cdk');

    process.stdout.write(app.run());

The process of creating your AWS resources using the |cdk| is straightforward:

1. Install the |cdk| on your development machine
2. Run the **cdk init** command to create the skeleton of your program
   in one of the supported programming languages
3. Use your favorite development environment to define your AWS application infrastructure
   using the |l2|
4. Compile your code, if necessary
5. (Optional) Run the |cdk| toolkit **cdk synth** command to see what your |CFN| template looks like
6. Run the |cdk| toolkit **cdk deploy** command to deploy the resulting |CFN| template
   and create the AWS resources in your AWS account
7. Repeats steps 3-6 until you are satisfied with your resources

.. note:: There is no charge for using the |cdk|, however you may incur AWS charges for creating or using AWS
          `chargeable resources <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#chargeable-resources>`_,
          such as running |EC2| instances or using |S3| storage.
          Use the
          `AWS Simple Monthly Calculator <http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>`_
          to estimate charges for the use of various AWS resources.

About Amazon Web Services
=========================

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of digital infrastructure services that developers can
leverage when developing their applications. The services include computing, storage, database, and
application synchronization (messaging and queuing).

AWS uses a pay-as-you-go service model. You are charged only for the services that you |mdash| or
your applications |mdash| use. Also, to make AWS useful as a platform for prototyping and
experimentation, AWS offers a free usage tier, in which services are free below a certain level of
usage. For more information about AWS costs and the free usage tier, see
`Test-Driving AWS in the Free Usage Tier <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-free-tier.html>`_.

To obtain an AWS account, go to `aws.amazon.com <https://aws.amazon.com>`_ and click :guilabel:`Create an AWS Account`.
