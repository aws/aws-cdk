|cdk| Glossary
##############

The |cdk| uses the following terms.
Some are based on AWS CloudFormation `concepts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-concepts.html>`_.

app
   An executable program that the |cdk| uses to synthesize a |CFN| template.
   Apps are:

   * Written by a user
   * Contain one or more stacks that can be deployed into multiple AWS environments
   * Define the infrastructure of your application

   Apps extend the :py:class:`aws-cdk.App` class.

applet
   A reusable |cdk| construct that can be instantiated and deployed through a
   YAML-format file.

|cdk-long| (|cdk|)
   An AWS toolkit that enables infrastructure as code (IaC), exposing AWS
   resources and high-level constructs for use in popular DevOps programming
   languages.

construct
   The building block of an |cdk| app or library. In code, they are instances of
   the :py:class:`aws-cdk.Construct` class or a class that extends the
   :py:class:`aws-cdk.Construct` class.

environment
   An AWS deployment target for |cdk| stacks, defined by a specific AWS account and region.

|l1|
   The lowest-level construct, which maps directly to an |CFN| resource,
   as described in the
   `AWS Resource Types Reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html>`_.
   These constructs are available in the :py:mod:`@aws-cdk/resources` package,
   as the |CFN| name, in lower case, with a **Resource** suffix within the AWS service namespace,
   such as **sqs.QueueResource**, which represents an |SQS| queue.

|l2|
   A construct that provides high-level APIs for AWS services.
   Their names imply the underlying AWS service.
   For example, |S3| resources are available through the **@aws-cdk/s3** package.

.. |l3|
   A construct that abstracts common architectural
   patterns on AWS. These are not supplied with the standard |cdk| distribution,
   but are shared within your organization or on GitHub.

stack
   An |cdk| construct that can be deployed into an environment.
   Stacks extend the :py:class:`aws-cdk.Stack` class.
