Welcome

Welcome to the |cdk-long| (|cdk|) User Guide!

The |cdk| is an infrastructure modeling framework that allows you to define your
cloud resources using an imperative programming interface. *The CDK is currently
in developer preview. We look forward to community feedback and collaboration*.

To get started see :doc:`getting-started`

Developers can use one of the supported programming languages to define reusable
cloud components called :doc:`constructs`, which are composed together into
:doc:`stacks` and :doc:`apps`.

The :ref:`AWS CDK Toolkit <toolkit>` is a command-line tool for interacting with CDK
apps. It allows developers to synthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation
Templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts and "diff" against a
deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change.

The :doc:`AWS Construct Library <aws-construct-lib>` includes a module for each
AWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of
how to use AWS. The AWS Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and
glue-logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals
on AWS.

.. note:: There is no charge for using the |cdk|, however you may incur AWS charges for creating or using AWS
          `chargeable resources <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#chargeable-resources>`_,
          such as running |EC2| instances or using |S3| storage.
          Use the
          `AWS Simple Monthly Calculator <http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>`_
          to estimate charges for the use of various AWS resources.

About Amazon Web Services
=========================

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of digital infrastructure services that developers can
leverage when developing their applications. The services include computing, storage, database, and
application synchronization (messaging and queuing).

AWS uses a pay-as-you-go service model. You are charged only for the services that you |mdash| or
your applications |mdash| use. Also, to make AWS useful as a platform for prototyping and
experimentation, AWS offers a free usage tier, in which services are free below a certain level of
usage. For more information about AWS costs and the free usage tier, see
`Test-Driving AWS in the Free Usage Tier <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-free-tier.html>`_.

To obtain an AWS account, go to `aws.amazon.com <https://aws.amazon.com>`_ and click :guilabel:`Create an AWS Account`.
