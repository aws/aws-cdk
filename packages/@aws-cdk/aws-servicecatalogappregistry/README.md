The `@aws-cdk/aws-servicecatalogappregistry` package contains resources that enable users to automate governance and management of their AWS resources at scale.

```ts nofixture
import * as appreg from '@aws-cdk/aws-servicecatalogappregistry';
```

## Application

An AppRegistry application enables you to define your applications and associated resources.
The application name must be unique at the account level and it's immutable.

```ts
const application = new appreg.Application(this, 'MyFirstApplication', {
  applicationName: 'MyFirstApplicationName',
  description: 'description for my application', // the description is optional
});
```

An application that has been created outside of the stack can be imported into your CDK app.
Applications can be imported by their ARN via the `Application.fromApplicationArn()` API:

```ts
const importedApplication = appreg.Application.fromApplicationArn(
  this,
  'MyImportedApplication',
  'arn:aws:servicecatalog:us-east-1:012345678910:/applications/0aqmvxvgmry0ecc4mjhwypun6i',
);
```

## Application-Associator

If you want to create an Application named `MyAssociatedApplication` in account `123456789012` and region `us-east-1`
and want to associate all stacks in the `App` scope to `MyAssociatedApplication`, then use as shown in the example below:

```ts
const app = new App();
const associatedApp = new appreg.ApplicationAssociator(app, 'AssociatedApplication', {
    applicationName: 'MyAssociatedApplication',
    description: 'Testing associated application',
    stackProps: {
        stackName: 'MyAssociatedApplicationStack',
        env: {account: '123456789012', region: 'us-east-1'},
    },
});
```

If you want to re-use an existing Application with ARN: `arn:aws:servicecatalog:us-east-1:123456789012:/applications/applicationId`
and want to associate all stacks in the `App` scope to your imported application, then use as shown in the example below:

```ts
const app = new App();
const associatedApp = new appreg.ApplicationAssociator(app, 'AssociatedApplication', {
    applicationArnValue: 'arn:aws:servicecatalog:us-east-1:123456789012:/applications/applicationId',
    stackProps: {
        stackName: 'MyAssociatedApplicationStack',
    },
});
```

If you are using CDK Pipelines to deploy your application, the application stacks will be inside Stages, and 
ApplicationAssociator will not be able to find them. Call `associateStage` on each Stage object before adding it to the 
Pipeline, as shown in the example below:

```ts
import * as cdk from "@aws-cdk/core";
import * as codepipeline from "@aws-cdk/pipelines";
import * as codecommit from "@aws-cdk/aws-codecommit";
declare const repo: codecommit.Repository;
declare const pipeline: codepipeline.CodePipeline;
declare const beta: cdk.Stage;
class ApplicationPipelineStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props: ApplicationPipelineStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    
   //associate the stage to application associator.
   props.application.associateStage(beta);
   pipeline.addStage(beta);
  }
};

interface ApplicationPipelineStackProps extends cdk.StackProps {
  application: appreg.ApplicationAssociator;
};

const app = new App();
const associatedApp = new appreg.ApplicationAssociator(app, 'AssociatedApplication', {
    applicationName: 'MyPipelineAssociatedApplication',
    description: 'Testing pipeline associated app',
    stackProps: {
        stackName: 'MyPipelineAssociatedApplicationStack',
        env: {account: '123456789012', region: 'us-east-1'},
    },
});

const cdkPipeline = new ApplicationPipelineStack(app, 'CDKApplicationPipelineStack', {
    application: associatedApp,
    env: {account: '123456789012', region: 'us-east-1'},
});
```

## Attribute Group

An AppRegistry attribute group acts as a container for user-defined attributes for an application.
Metadata is attached in a machine-readble format to integrate with automated workflows and tools.

```ts
const attributeGroup = new appreg.AttributeGroup(this, 'MyFirstAttributeGroup', {
  attributeGroupName: 'MyFirstAttributeGroupName',
  description: 'description for my attribute group', // the description is optional,
  attributes: {
    project: 'foo',
    team: ['member1', 'member2', 'member3'],
    public: false,
    stages: {
      alpha: 'complete',
      beta: 'incomplete',
      release: 'not started'
    }
  }
});
```

An attribute group that has been created outside of the stack can be imported into your CDK app.
Attribute groups can be imported by their ARN via the `AttributeGroup.fromAttributeGroupArn()` API:

```ts
const importedAttributeGroup = appreg.AttributeGroup.fromAttributeGroupArn(
  this,
  'MyImportedAttrGroup',
  'arn:aws:servicecatalog:us-east-1:012345678910:/attribute-groups/0aqmvxvgmry0ecc4mjhwypun6i',
);
```

## Associations

You can associate your appregistry application with attribute groups and resources.
Resources are CloudFormation stacks that you can associate with an application to group relevant
stacks together to enable metadata rich insights into your applications and resources.
A Cloudformation stack can only be associated with one appregistry application.
If a stack is associated with multiple applications in your app or is already associated with one,
CDK will fail at deploy time.

### Associating application with an attribute group

You can associate an attribute group with an application with the `associateAttributeGroup()` API:

```ts
declare const application: appreg.Application;
declare const attributeGroup: appreg.AttributeGroup;
application.associateAttributeGroup(attributeGroup);
```

### Associating application with a Stack

You can associate a stack with an application with the `associateStack()` API:

```ts
const app = new App();
const myStack = new Stack(app, 'MyStack');

declare const application: appreg.Application;
application.associateStack(myStack);
```

## Sharing

You can share your AppRegistry applications and attribute groups with AWS Organizations, Organizational Units (OUs), AWS accounts within an organization, as well as IAM roles and users. AppRegistry requires that AWS Organizations is enabled in an account before deploying a share of an application or attribute group.

### Sharing an application

```ts
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';
declare const application: appreg.Application;
declare const myRole: iam.IRole;
declare const myUser: iam.IUser;
application.shareApplication({
  accounts: ['123456789012'],
  organizationArns: ['arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:organization/o-my-org-id'],
  roles: [myRole],
  users: [myUser],
});
```

E.g., sharing an application with multiple accounts and allowing the accounts to associate resources to the application.

```ts
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';
declare const application: appreg.Application;
application.shareApplication({
  accounts: ['123456789012', '234567890123'],
  sharePermission: appreg.SharePermission.ALLOW_ACCESS,
});
```

### Sharing an attribute group

```ts
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';
declare const attributeGroup: appreg.AttributeGroup;
declare const myRole: iam.IRole;
declare const myUser: iam.IUser;
attributeGroup.shareAttributeGroup({
  accounts: ['123456789012'],
  organizationArns: ['arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:organization/o-my-org-id'],
  roles: [myRole],
  users: [myUser],
});
```

E.g., sharing an application with multiple accounts and allowing the accounts to associate applications to the attribute group.

```ts
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';
declare const attributeGroup: appreg.AttributeGroup;
attributeGroup.shareAttributeGroup({
  accounts: ['123456789012', '234567890123'],
  sharePermission: appreg.SharePermission.ALLOW_ACCESS,
});
```
