This construct library allows you to define [Amazon Elastic Container Service
for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) clusters programmatically.
This library also supports programmatically defining Kubernetes resource
manifests within EKS clusters.

This example defines an Amazon EKS cluster with the following configuration:

- Managed nodegroup with 2x **m5.large** instances (this instance type suits most common use-cases, and is good value for money)
- Dedicated VPC with default configuration (see [ec2.Vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-ec2-readme.html#vpc))
- A Kubernetes pod with a container based on the [paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes) image.

```ts
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'hello-eks', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
});

// apply a kubernetes manifest to the cluster
cluster.addManifest('mypod', {
  apiVersion: 'v1',
  kind: 'Pod',
  metadata: { name: 'mypod' },
  spec: {
    containers: [
      {
        name: 'hello',
        image: 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5',
        ports: [ { containerPort: 8080 } ]
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

In order to interact with your cluster through `kubectl`, you can use the `aws
eks update-kubeconfig` [AWS CLI command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/eks/update-kubeconfig.html)
to configure your local kubeconfig.

The EKS module will define a CloudFormation output in your stack which contains
the command to run. For example:

```
Outputs:
ClusterConfigCommand43AAE40F = aws eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster-xxxxx --role-arn arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/yyyyy
```

> The IAM role specified in this command is called the "**masters role**". This is
> an IAM role that is associated with the `system:masters` [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
> group and has super-user access to the cluster.
>
> You can specify this role using the `mastersRole` option, or otherwise a role will be
> automatically created for you. This role can be assumed by anyone in the account with
> `sts:AssumeRole` permissions for this role.

Execute the `aws eks update-kubeconfig ...` command in your terminal to create a
local kubeconfig:

```console
$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster-xxxxx --role-arn arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/yyyyy
Added new context arn:aws:eks:rrrrr:112233445566:cluster/cluster-xxxxx to /home/boom/.kube/config
```

And now you can simply use `kubectl`:

```console
$ kubectl get all -n kube-system
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/aws-node-fpmwv             1/1     Running   0          21m
pod/aws-node-m9htf             1/1     Running   0          21m
pod/coredns-5cb4fb54c7-q222j   1/1     Running   0          23m
pod/coredns-5cb4fb54c7-v9nxx   1/1     Running   0          23m
...
```

### Endpoint Access

You can configure the [cluster endpoint access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html) by using the `endpointAccess` property:

```typescript
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'hello-eks', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
  endpointAccess: eks.EndpointAccess.PRIVATE // No access outside of your VPC.
});
```

The default value is `eks.EndpointAccess.PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE`. Which means the cluster endpoint is accessible from outside of your VPC, and worker node traffic to the endpoint will stay within your VPC.

### Capacity

By default, `eks.Cluster` is created with a managed nodegroup with x2 `m5.large` instances. You must specify the kubernetes version for the cluster with the `version` property.

```ts
new eks.Cluster(this, 'cluster-two-m5-large', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
});
```

To use the traditional self-managed Amazon EC2 instances instead, set `defaultCapacityType` to `DefaultCapacityType.EC2`

```ts
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'cluster-self-managed-ec2', {
  defaultCapacityType: eks.DefaultCapacityType.EC2,
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
});
```

The quantity and instance type for the default capacity can be specified through
the `defaultCapacity` and `defaultCapacityInstance` props:

```ts
new eks.Cluster(this, 'cluster', {
  defaultCapacity: 10,
  defaultCapacityInstance: new ec2.InstanceType('m2.xlarge'),
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
});
```

To disable the default capacity, simply set `defaultCapacity` to `0`:

```ts
new eks.Cluster(this, 'cluster-with-no-capacity', {
  defaultCapacity: 0,
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
});
```

The `cluster.defaultCapacity` property will reference the `AutoScalingGroup`
resource for the default capacity. It will be `undefined` if `defaultCapacity`
is set to `0` or `defaultCapacityType` is either `NODEGROUP` or undefined.

And the `cluster.defaultNodegroup` property will reference the `Nodegroup`
resource for the default capacity. It will be `undefined` if `defaultCapacity`
is set to `0` or `defaultCapacityType` is `EC2`.

You can add `AutoScalingGroup` resource as customized capacity through `cluster.addCapacity()` or
`cluster.addAutoScalingGroup()`:

```ts
cluster.addCapacity('frontend-nodes', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t2.medium'),
  minCapacity: 3,
  vpcSubnets: { subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC }
});
```

### Managed Node Groups

Amazon EKS managed node groups automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of nodes (Amazon EC2 instances)
for Amazon EKS Kubernetes clusters. By default, `eks.Nodegroup` create a nodegroup with x2 `t3.medium` instances.

```ts
new eks.Nodegroup(stack, 'nodegroup', { cluster });
```

You can add customized node group through `cluster.addNodegroup()`:

```ts
cluster.addNodegroup('nodegroup', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('m5.large'),
  minSize: 4,
});
```


### Fargate

AWS Fargate is a technology that provides on-demand, right-sized compute
capacity for containers. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision,
configure, or scale groups of virtual machines to run containers. This removes
the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your node groups, or
optimize cluster packing.

You can control which pods start on Fargate and how they run with Fargate
Profiles, which are defined as part of your Amazon EKS cluster.

See [Fargate
Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html#fargate-considerations)
in the AWS EKS User Guide.

You can add Fargate Profiles to any EKS cluster defined in your CDK app
through the `addFargateProfile()` method. The following example adds a profile
that will match all pods from the "default" namespace:

```ts
cluster.addFargateProfile('MyProfile', {
  selectors: [ { namespace: 'default' } ]
});
```

To create an EKS cluster that **only** uses Fargate capacity, you can use
`FargateCluster`.

The following code defines an Amazon EKS cluster without EC2 capacity and a default
Fargate Profile that matches all pods from the "kube-system" and "default" namespaces. It is also configured to [run CoreDNS on Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-getting-started.html#fargate-gs-coredns) through the `coreDnsComputeType` cluster option.

```ts
const cluster = new eks.FargateCluster(this, 'MyCluster', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
});

 // apply k8s resources on this cluster
cluster.addManifest(...);
```

**NOTE**: Classic Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers are not supported on
pods running on Fargate. For ingress, we recommend that you use the [ALB Ingress
Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html)
on Amazon EKS (minimum version v1.1.4).

### Spot Capacity

If `spotPrice` is specified, the capacity will be purchased from spot instances:

```ts
cluster.addCapacity('spot', {
  spotPrice: '0.1094',
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t3.large'),
  maxCapacity: 10
});
```

Spot instance nodes will be labeled with `lifecycle=Ec2Spot` and tainted with `PreferNoSchedule`.

The [AWS Node Termination Handler](https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler)
DaemonSet will be installed from [
Amazon EKS Helm chart repository
](https://github.com/aws/eks-charts/tree/master/stable/aws-node-termination-handler) on these nodes. The termination handler ensures that the Kubernetes control plane responds appropriately to events that can cause your EC2 instance to become unavailable, such as [EC2 maintenance events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html) and [EC2 Spot interruptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html) and helps gracefully stop all pods running on spot nodes that are about to be
terminated.

### Bootstrapping

When adding capacity, you can specify options for
[/etc/eks/boostrap.sh](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/bootstrap.sh)
which is responsible for associating the node to the EKS cluster. For example,
you can use `kubeletExtraArgs` to add custom node labels or taints.

```ts
// up to ten spot instances
cluster.addCapacity('spot', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t3.large'),
  minCapacity: 2,
  bootstrapOptions: {
    kubeletExtraArgs: '--node-labels foo=bar,goo=far',
    awsApiRetryAttempts: 5
  }
});
```

To disable bootstrapping altogether (i.e. to fully customize user-data), set `bootstrapEnabled` to `false` when you add
the capacity.

### Kubernetes Resources

The `KubernetesManifest` construct or `cluster.addManifest` method can be used
to apply Kubernetes resource manifests to this cluster.

The following examples will deploy the [paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes)
service on the cluster:

```ts
const appLabel = { app: "hello-kubernetes" };

const deployment = {
  apiVersion: "apps/v1",
  kind: "Deployment",
  metadata: { name: "hello-kubernetes" },
  spec: {
    replicas: 3,
    selector: { matchLabels: appLabel },
    template: {
      metadata: { labels: appLabel },
      spec: {
        containers: [
          {
            name: "hello-kubernetes",
            image: "paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5",
            ports: [ { containerPort: 8080 } ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
};

const service = {
  apiVersion: "v1",
  kind: "Service",
  metadata: { name: "hello-kubernetes" },
  spec: {
    type: "LoadBalancer",
    ports: [ { port: 80, targetPort: 8080 } ],
    selector: appLabel
  }
};

// option 1: use a construct
new KubernetesManifest(this, 'hello-kub', {
  cluster,
  manifest: [ deployment, service ]
});

// or, option2: use `addManifest`
cluster.addManifest('hello-kub', service, deployment);
```

##### Kubectl Environment

The resources are created in the cluster by running `kubectl apply` from a python lambda function. You can configure the environment of this function by specifying it at cluster instantiation. For example, this can useful in order to configure an http proxy:

```typescript
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'hello-eks', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
  kubectlEnvironment: {
    'http_proxy': 'http://proxy.myproxy.com'
  }
});

```

#### Adding resources from a URL

The following example will deploy the resource manifest hosting on remote server:

```ts
import * as yaml from 'js-yaml';
import * as request from 'sync-request';

const manifestUrl = 'https://url/of/manifest.yaml';
const manifest = yaml.safeLoadAll(request('GET', manifestUrl).getBody());
cluster.addManifest('my-resource', ...manifest);
```

Since Kubernetes resources are implemented as CloudFormation resources in the
CDK. This means that if the resource is deleted from your code (or the stack is
deleted), the next `cdk deploy` will issue a `kubectl delete` command and the
Kubernetes resources will be deleted.

#### Dependencies

There are cases where Kubernetes resources must be deployed in a specific order.
For example, you cannot define a resource in a Kubernetes namespace before the
namespace was created.

You can represent dependencies between `KubernetesManifest`s using
`resource.node.addDependency()`:

```ts
const namespace = cluster.addManifest('my-namespace', {
  apiVersion: 'v1',
  kind: 'Namespace',
  metadata: { name: 'my-app' }
});

const service = cluster.addManifest('my-service', {
  metadata: {
    name: 'myservice',
    namespace: 'my-app'
  },
  spec: // ...
});

service.node.addDependency(namespace); // will apply `my-namespace` before `my-service`.
```

NOTE: when a `KubernetesManifest` includes multiple resources (either directly
or through `cluster.addManifest()`) (e.g. `cluster.addManifest('foo', r1, r2,
r3,...))`), these resources will be applied as a single manifest via `kubectl`
and will be applied sequentially (the standard behavior in `kubectl`).

### Patching Kubernetes Resources

The `KubernetesPatch` construct can be used to update existing kubernetes
resources. The following example can be used to patch the `hello-kubernetes`
deployment from the example above with 5 replicas.

```ts
new KubernetesPatch(this, 'hello-kub-deployment-label', {
  cluster,
  resourceName: "deployment/hello-kubernetes",
  applyPatch: { spec: { replicas: 5 } },
  restorePatch: { spec: { replicas: 3 } }
})
```

### Querying Kubernetes Object Values

The `KubernetesObjectValue` construct can be used to query for information about kubernetes objects,
and use that as part of your CDK application.

For example, you can fetch the address of a [`LoadBalancer`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) type service:

```typescript
// query the load balancer address
const myServiceAddress = new KubernetesObjectValue(this, 'LoadBalancerAttribute', {
  cluster: cluster,
  resourceType: 'service',
  resourceName: 'my-service',
  jsonPath: '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname', // https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/
});

// pass the address to a lambda function
const proxyFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'ProxyFunction', {
  ...
  environment: {
    myServiceAddress: myServiceAddress.value
  },
})
```

Specifically, since the above use-case is quite common, there is an easier way to access that information:

```typescript
const loadBalancerAddress = cluster.getServiceLoadBalancerAddress('my-service');
```

### AWS IAM Mapping

As described in the [Amazon EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html),
you can map AWS IAM users and roles to [Kubernetes Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac).

The Amazon EKS construct manages the **aws-auth ConfigMap** Kubernetes resource
on your behalf and exposes an API through the `cluster.awsAuth` for mapping
users, roles and accounts.

Furthermore, when auto-scaling capacity is added to the cluster (through
`cluster.addCapacity` or `cluster.addAutoScalingGroup`), the IAM instance role
of the auto-scaling group will be automatically mapped to RBAC so nodes can
connect to the cluster. No manual mapping is required any longer.

For example, let's say you want to grant an IAM user administrative privileges
on your cluster:

```ts
const adminUser = new iam.User(this, 'Admin');
cluster.awsAuth.addUserMapping(adminUser, { groups: [ 'system:masters' ]});
```

A convenience method for mapping a role to the `system:masters` group is also available:

```ts
cluster.awsAuth.addMastersRole(role)
```

### Cluster Security Group

When you create an Amazon EKS cluster, a
[cluster security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html)
is automatically created as well. This security group is designed to allow
all traffic from the control plane and managed node groups to flow freely
between each other.

The ID for that security group can be retrieved after creating the cluster.

```ts
const clusterSecurityGroupId = cluster.clusterSecurityGroupId;
```

### Cluster Encryption Configuration

When you create an Amazon EKS cluster, envelope encryption of
Kubernetes secrets using the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) can be enabled. The documentation
on [creating a cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html)
can provide more details about the customer master key (CMK) that can be used for the encryption.

You can use the `secretsEncryptionKey` to configure which key the cluster will use to encrypt Kubernetes secrets. By default, an AWS Managed key will be used. 

> This setting can only be specified when the cluster is created and cannot be updated.


```ts
const secretsKey = new kms.Key(this, 'SecretsKey');
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'MyCluster', {
  secretsEncryptionKey: secretsKey,
  // ...
});
```

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that CMK can be retrieved.

```ts
const clusterEncryptionConfigKeyArn = cluster.clusterEncryptionConfigKeyArn;
```

### Node ssh Access

If you want to be able to SSH into your worker nodes, you must already
have an SSH key in the region you're connecting to and pass it, and you must
be able to connect to the hosts (meaning they must have a public IP and you
should be allowed to connect to them on port 22):

[ssh into nodes example](test/example.ssh-into-nodes.lit.ts)

If you want to SSH into nodes in a private subnet, you should set up a
bastion host in a public subnet. That setup is recommended, but is
unfortunately beyond the scope of this documentation.

### Helm Charts

The `HelmChart` construct or `cluster.addChart` method can be used
to add Kubernetes resources to this cluster using Helm.

The following example will install the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)
to you cluster using Helm.

```ts
// option 1: use a construct
new HelmChart(this, 'NginxIngress', {
  cluster,
  chart: 'nginx-ingress',
  repository: 'https://helm.nginx.com/stable',
  namespace: 'kube-system'
});

// or, option2: use `addChart`
cluster.addChart('NginxIngress', {
  chart: 'nginx-ingress',
  repository: 'https://helm.nginx.com/stable',
  namespace: 'kube-system'
});
```

Helm charts will be installed and updated using `helm upgrade --install`, where a few parameters
are being passed down (such as `repo`, `values`, `version`, `namespace`, `wait`, `timeout`, etc).
This means that if the chart is added to CDK with the same release name, it will try to update
the chart in the cluster. The chart will exists as CloudFormation resource.

Helm charts are implemented as CloudFormation resources in CDK.
This means that if the chart is deleted from your code (or the stack is
deleted), the next `cdk deploy` will issue a `helm uninstall` command and the
Helm chart will be deleted.

When there is no `release` defined, the chart will be installed using the `node.uniqueId`,
which will be lower cased and truncated to the last 63 characters.

By default, all Helm charts will be installed concurrently. In some cases, this
could cause race conditions where two Helm charts attempt to deploy the same
resource or if Helm charts depend on each other. You can use
`chart.node.addDependency()` in order to declare a dependency order between
charts:

```ts
const chart1 = cluster.addChart(...);
const chart2 = cluster.addChart(...);

chart2.node.addDependency(chart1);
```

### Bottlerocket

[Bottlerocket](https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/) is a Linux-based open-source operating system that is purpose-built by Amazon Web Services for running containers on virtual machines or bare metal hosts. At this moment the managed nodegroup only supports Amazon EKS-optimized AMI but it's possible to create a capacity of self-managed `AutoScalingGroup` running with bottlerocket Linux AMI.

> **NOTICE**: Bottlerocket is in public preview and only available in [some supported AWS regions](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/QUICKSTART.md#finding-an-ami).

The following example will create a capacity with self-managed Amazon EC2 capacity of 2 `t3.small` Linux instances running with `Bottlerocket` AMI.

```ts
// add bottlerocket nodes
cluster.addCapacity('BottlerocketNodes', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t3.small'),
  minCapacity:  2,
  machineImageType: eks.MachineImageType.BOTTLEROCKET
});
```

To define only Bottlerocket capacity in your cluster, set `defaultCapacity` to `0` when you define the cluster as described above.

Please note Bottlerocket does not allow to customize bootstrap options and `bootstrapOptions` properties is not supported when you create the `Bottlerocket` capacity.

### Service Accounts

With services account you can provide Kubernetes Pods access to AWS resources.

```ts
// add service account
const sa = cluster.addServiceAccount('MyServiceAccount');

const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'Bucket');
bucket.grantReadWrite(serviceAccount);

const mypod = cluster.addManifest('mypod', {
  apiVersion: 'v1',
  kind: 'Pod',
  metadata: { name: 'mypod' },
  spec: {
    serviceAccountName: sa.serviceAccountName
    containers: [
      {
        name: 'hello',
        image: 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5',
        ports: [ { containerPort: 8080 } ],

      }
    ]
  }
});

// create the resource after the service account
mypod.node.addDependency(sa);

// print the IAM role arn for this service account
new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'ServiceAccountIamRole', { value: sa.role.roleArn })
```

### Roadmap

- [ ] AutoScaling (combine EC2 and Kubernetes scaling)
