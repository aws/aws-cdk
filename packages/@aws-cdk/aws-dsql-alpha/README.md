Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine. This engine is optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Neptune supports the popular graph query languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and W3C’s SPARQL, enabling you to build queries that efficiently navigate highly connected datasets.

The `@aws-cdk/aws-dsql-alpha` package contains primitives for setting up Aurora DSQL clusters.

```ts nofixture
import * as dsql from '@aws-cdk/aws-dsql-alpha';
```

## Creating an Aurora DSQL Cluster

To create an Aurora DSQL cluster, define a `Cluster`.

```ts
const cluster = new dsql.Cluster(this, 'Cluster', {
  clusterName: 'my-dsql-cluster',
  deletionProtection: true,
});
```

## Granting Connect Access

You can grant IAM principals the ability to connect to the cluster:

```ts
const role = new iam.Role(this, 'DBRole', { assumedBy: new iam.AccountPrincipal(this.account) });
const cluster = new dsql.Cluster(this, 'Cluster');

// Use one of the following statements to grant the role the necessary permissions
cluster.grantConnect(role); // Grant the role dsql:DbConnect
cluster.grantConnectAdmin(role); // Grant the role dsql:DbConnectAdmin
cluster.grant(role, 'dqsl:DbConnect'); // Grant the role the specified actions to the cluster
```
