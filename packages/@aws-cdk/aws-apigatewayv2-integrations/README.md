## HTTP APIs

Integrations connect a route to backend resources. HTTP APIs support Lambda proxy, AWS service, and HTTP proxy integrations. HTTP proxy integrations are also known as private integrations.

### Lambda

Lambda integrations enable integrating an HTTP API route with a Lambda function. When a client invokes the route, the
API Gateway service forwards the request to the Lambda function and returns the function's response to the client.

The API Gateway service will invoke the lambda function with an event payload of a specific format. The service expects
the function to respond in a specific format. The details on this format is available at [Working with AWS Lambda
proxy integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html).

The following code configures a route `GET /books` with a Lambda proxy integration.

```ts
const booksFn = new lambda.Function(stack, 'BooksDefaultFn', { ... });
const booksIntegration = new LambdaProxyIntegration({
  handler: booksDefaultFn,
});

const httpApi = new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpApi');

httpApi.addRoutes({
  path: '/books',
  methods: [ HttpMethod.GET ],
  integration: booksIntegration,
});
```

### HTTP Proxy

HTTP Proxy integrations enables connecting an HTTP API route to a publicly routable HTTP endpoint. When a client
invokes the route, the API Gateway service forwards the entire request and response between the API Gateway endpoint
and the integrating HTTP endpoint. More information can be found at [Working with HTTP proxy
integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-http.html).

The following code configures a route `GET /books` with an HTTP proxy integration to an HTTP endpoint
`get-books-proxy.myproxy.internal`.

```ts
const booksIntegration = new HttpProxyIntegration({
  url: 'https://get-books-proxy.myproxy.internal',
});

const httpApi = new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpApi');

httpApi.addRoutes({
  path: '/books',
  methods: [ HttpMethod.GET ],
  integration: booksIntegration,
});
```

### Private Integration

Private integrations enable integrating an HTTP API route with private resources in a VPC, such as Application Load Balancers or
Amazon ECS container-based applications.  Using private integrations, resources in a VPC can be exposed for access by
clients outside of the VPC.

The following integrations are supported for private resources in a VPC.

#### Application Load Balancer

The following code is a basic application load balancer private integration of HTTP API:

```ts
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(stack, 'VPC');
const lb = new elbv2.ALB(stack, 'lb', { vpc });
const listener = lb.addListener('listener', { port: 80 });
listener.addTargets('target', {
  port: 80,
});

const httpEndpoint = new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpProxyPrivateApi', {
  defaultIntegration: new HttpAlbIntegration({
    listener,
  }),
});
```

When an imported load balancer is used, the `vpc` option must be specified for `HttpAlbIntegration`.

#### Network Load Balancer

The following code is a basic network load balancer private integration of HTTP API:

```ts
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(stack, 'VPC');
const lb = new elbv2.NLB(stack, 'lb', { vpc });
const listener = lb.addListener('listener', { port: 80 });
listener.addTargets('target', {
  port: 80,
});

const httpEndpoint = new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpProxyPrivateApi', {
  defaultIntegration: new HttpNlbIntegration({
    listener,
  }),
});
```

When an imported load balancer is used, the `vpc` option must be specified for `HttpNlbIntegration`.

#### Cloud Map Service Discovery

The following code is a basic discovery service private integration of HTTP API:

```ts
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(stack, 'VPC');
const vpcLink = new VpcLink(stack, 'VpcLink', { vpc });
const namespace = new servicediscovery.PrivateDnsNamespace(stack, 'Namespace', {
  name: 'boobar.com',
  vpc,
});
const service = namespace.createService('Service');

const httpEndpoint = new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpProxyPrivateApi', {
  defaultIntegration: new HttpServiceDiscoveryIntegration({
    vpcLink,
    service,
  }),
});
```
