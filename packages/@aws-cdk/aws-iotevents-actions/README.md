This library contains integration classes to specify actions of state events of Detector Model in `@aws-cdk/aws-iotevents`.
Instances of these classes should be passed to `State` defined in `@aws-cdk/aws-iotevents`
You can define built-in actions to use a timer or set a variable, or send data to other AWS resources.
