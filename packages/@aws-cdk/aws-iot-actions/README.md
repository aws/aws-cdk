This library contains integration classes to send data to any number of
supported AWS Services. Instances of these classes should be passed to
`TopicRule` defined in `@aws-cdk/aws-iot`.

Currently supported are:

- Republish a message to another MQTT topic
- Invoke a Lambda function
- Put objects to a S3 bucket
- Put logs to CloudWatch Logs
- Capture CloudWatch metrics
- Change state for a CloudWatch alarm
- Put records to Kinesis Data stream
- Put records to Kinesis Data Firehose stream
- Send messages to SQS queues
- Publish messages on SNS topics
- Write messages into columns of DynamoDB
- Put messages IoT Events input

## Republish a message to another MQTT topic

The code snippet below creates an AWS IoT Rule that republish a message to
another MQTT topic when it is triggered.

```ts
new iot.TopicRule(this, 'TopicRule', {
  sql: iot.IotSql.fromStringAsVer20160323("SELECT topic(2) as device_id, timestamp() as timestamp, temperature FROM 'device/+/data'"),
  actions: [
    new actions.IotRepublishMqttAction('${topic()}/republish', {
      qualityOfService: actions.MqttQualityOfService.AT_LEAST_ONCE, // optional property, default is MqttQualityOfService.ZERO_OR_MORE_TIMES
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Invoke a Lambda function

The code snippet below creates an AWS IoT Rule that invoke a Lambda function
when it is triggered.

```ts
const func = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: lambda.Code.fromInline(`
    exports.handler = (event) => {
      console.log("It is test for lambda action of AWS IoT Rule.", event);
    };`
  ),
});

new iot.TopicRule(this, 'TopicRule', {
  sql: iot.IotSql.fromStringAsVer20160323("SELECT topic(2) as device_id, timestamp() as timestamp, temperature FROM 'device/+/data'"),
  actions: [new actions.LambdaFunctionAction(func)],
});
```

## Put objects to a S3 bucket

The code snippet below creates an AWS IoT Rule that puts objects to a S3 bucket
when it is triggered.

```ts
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket');

new iot.TopicRule(this, 'TopicRule', {
  sql: iot.IotSql.fromStringAsVer20160323("SELECT topic(2) as device_id FROM 'device/+/data'"),
  actions: [new actions.S3PutObjectAction(bucket)],
});
```

The property `key` of `S3PutObjectAction` is given the value `${topic()}/${timestamp()}` by default. This `${topic()}`
and `${timestamp()}` is called Substitution templates. For more information see 
[this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-substitution-templates.html).
In above sample, `${topic()}` is replaced by a given MQTT topic as `device/001/data`. And `${timestamp()}` is replaced
by the number of the current timestamp in milliseconds as `1636289461203`. So if the MQTT broker receives an MQTT topic
`device/001/data` on `2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z`, the S3 bucket object will be put to `device/001/data/1636243200000`. 

You can also set specific `key` as following:

```ts
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket');

new iot.TopicRule(this, 'TopicRule', {
  sql: iot.IotSql.fromStringAsVer20160323(
    "SELECT topic(2) as device_id, year, month, day FROM 'device/+/data'",
  ),
  actions: [
    new actions.S3PutObjectAction(bucket, {
      key: '${year}/${month}/${day}/${topic(2)}',
    }),
  ],
});
```

If you wanna set access control to the S3 bucket object, you can specify `accessControl` as following:

```ts
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket');

new iot.TopicRule(this, 'TopicRule', {
  sql: iot.IotSql.fromStringAsVer20160323("SELECT * FROM 'device/+/data'"),
  actions: [
    new actions.S3PutObjectAction(bucket, {
      accessControl: s3.BucketAccessControl.PUBLIC_READ,
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Put logs to CloudWatch Logs

The code snippet below creates an AWS IoT Rule that puts logs to CloudWatch Logs
when it is triggered.

```ts
import * as logs from '@aws-cdk/aws-logs';

const logGroup = new logs.LogGroup(this, 'MyLogGroup');

new iot.TopicRule(this, 'TopicRule', {
  sql: iot.IotSql.fromStringAsVer20160323("SELECT topic(2) as device_id FROM 'device/+/data'"),
  actions: [new actions.CloudWatchLogsAction(logGroup)],
});
```

## Capture CloudWatch metrics

The code snippet below creates an AWS IoT Rule that capture CloudWatch metrics
when it is triggered.

```ts
const topicRule = new iot.TopicRule(this, 'TopicRule', {
  sql: iot.IotSql.fromStringAsVer20160323(
    "SELECT topic(2) as device_id, namespace, unit, value, timestamp FROM 'device/+/data'",
  ),
  actions: [
    new actions.CloudWatchPutMetricAction({
      metricName: '${topic(2)}',
      metricNamespace: '${namespace}',
      metricUnit: '${unit}',
      metricValue: '${value}',
      metricTimestamp: '${timestamp}',
    }),
  ],
});
```

  metricName: 'MyMetric',
  dimensions: { MyDimension: 'MyDimensionValue' },
});
const alarm = new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'MyAlarm', {
  metric: metric,
  threshold: 100,
  evaluationPeriods: 3,
  datapointsToAlarm: 2,
});

const topicRule = new iot.TopicRule(this, 'TopicRule', {
  sql: iot.IotSql.fromStringAsVer20160323("SELECT topic(2) as device_id FROM 'device/+/data'"),
  actions: [
    new actions.CloudWatchSetAlarmStateAction(alarm, {
      reason: 'AWS Iot Rule action is triggered',
      alarmStateToSet: cloudwatch.AlarmState.ALARM,
    }),
  ],
});
```

stream when it is triggered.

  actions: [
    new actions.KinesisPutRecordAction(stream, {
      partitionKey: '${newuuid()}',
    }),
  ],
});
```
