 * by the CLI by default in order to ensure that when the CDK app exists, all
 * assets are available for deployment. Otherwise, if an app references assets
 * in temporary locations, those will not be available when it exists (see
 * https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk/issues/1716).
 *
 * The `stagedPath` property is a stringified token that represents the location
 * of the file or directory after staging. It will be resolved only during the
 * "prepare" stage and may be either the original path or the staged path
 * depending on the context setting.
 *
 * The file/directory are staged based on their content hash (fingerprint). This
 * means that only if content was changed, copy will happen.
