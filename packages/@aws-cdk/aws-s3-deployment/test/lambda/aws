# the mock behaves as follows:
# - argvs are going to be written to "aws.out" (one command in each line)
# - if "aws s3 cp" is invoked, the destination will be populated with a test zip file.
# - for "cp" and "sync", "aws.out" argv[4] is replaced by "archive.zip" and "contents.zip"
#   becuase the actual value is a full path of a temporary directory
