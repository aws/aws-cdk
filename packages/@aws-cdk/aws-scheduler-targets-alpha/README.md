[Amazon EventBridge Scheduler](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-amazon-eventbridge-scheduler/) is a feature from Amazon EventBridge
that allows you to create, run, and manage scheduled tasks at scale. With EventBridge Scheduler, you can schedule one-time or recurrently tens 
of millions of tasks across many AWS services without provisioning or managing underlying infrastructure.

This library contains integration classes for Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to call any
number of supported AWS Services. 

The following targets are supported:

1. `targets.LambdaInvoke`: [Invoke an AWS Lambda function](#invoke-a-lambda-function))

## Invoke a Lambda function

Use the `LambdaInvoke` target to invoke a lambda function.

The code snippet below creates an event rule with a Lambda function as a target
called every hour by Event Bridge Scheduler with custom payload. You can optionally attach a
[dead letter queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/rule-dlq.html).

```ts
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

const fn = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunc', {
    runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST,
    handler: 'index.handler',
    code: lambda.Code.fromInline(`exports.handler = handler.toString()`),
});

const dlq = new sqs.Queue(this, "DLQ", {
    queueName: 'MyDLQ',
});

const target = new targets.LambdaInvoke(fn, {
    deadLetterQueue: dlq,
    maxEventAge: Duration.minutes(1),
    retryAttempts: 3,
    input: ScheduleTargetInput.fromObject({
        'payload': 'useful'
    }),
});

const schedule = new Schedule(this, 'Schedule', {
    schedule: ScheduleExpression.rate(Duration.hours(1)),
    target
});
```
