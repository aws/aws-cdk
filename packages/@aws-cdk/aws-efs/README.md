This construct library allows you to set up AWS Elastic File System (EFS).

```ts
import * as efs from '@aws-cdk/aws-efs';

const myVpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'VPC');
const fileSystem = new efs.FileSystem(this, 'MyEfsFileSystem', {
  vpc: myVpc,
  encrypted: true,
  lifecyclePolicy: efs.LifecyclePolicy.AFTER_14_DAYS,
  performanceMode: efs.PerformanceMode.GENERAL_PURPOSE,
  throughputMode: efs.ThroughputMode.BURSTING
});
```

A file system can set `RemovalPolicy`. Default policy is `RETAIN`.

```ts
const fileSystem =  new FileSystem(this, 'EfsFileSystem', {
  vpc,
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
});
```

### Access Point

An access point is an application-specific view into an EFS file system that applies an operating system user and
group, and a file system path, to any file system request made through the access point. The operating system user
and group override any identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is exposed as the
access point's root directory. Applications using the access point can only access data in its own directory and
below. To learn more, see [Mounting a File System Using EFS Access Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html).

Use `addAccessPoint` to create an access point from a fileSystem:

```ts
fileSystem.addAccessPoint('AccessPoint');
```

By default, when you create an access point, the root(`/`) directory is exposed to the client connecting to
the access point. You may specify custom path with the `path` property. If `path` does not exist, it will be
created with the settings defined in the `creationInfo`. See
[Creating Access Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/create-access-point.html) for more details.

Any access point that has been created outside the stack can be imported into your CDK app.

Use the `fromAccessPointAttributes()` API to import an existing access point.

```ts
efs.AccessPoint.fromAccessPointAttributes(this, 'ap', {
  accessPointArn: 'fsap-1293c4d9832fo0912',
  fileSystem: efs.FileSystem.fromFileSystemAttributes(this, 'efs', {
    fileSystemId: 'fs-099d3e2f',
    securityGroup: SecurityGroup.fromSecurityGroupId(this, 'sg', 'sg-51530134'),
  }),
});
```

⚠️ Notice: When importing an Access Point using `fromAccessPointAttributes()`, you must make sure the mount targets are deployed and their lifecycle state is `available`. Otherwise, you may encounter the following error when deploying:
> EFS file system <ARN of efs> referenced by access point <ARN of access point of EFS> has
mount targets created in all availability zones the function will execute in, but not all are in the available life cycle
state yet. Please wait for them to become available and try the request again.

### Connecting

To control who can access the EFS, use the `.connections` attribute. EFS has
a fixed default port, so you don't need to specify the port:

```ts
fileSystem.connections.allowDefaultPortFrom(instance);
```
### Mounting the file system using User Data

In order to automatically mount this file system during instance launch, 
following code can be used as reference:
```ts
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'VPC');

const fileSystem = new efs.FileSystem(this, 'MyEfsFileSystem', {
  vpc,
  encrypted: true,
  lifecyclePolicy: efs.LifecyclePolicy.AFTER_14_DAYS,
  performanceMode: efs.PerformanceMode.GENERAL_PURPOSE,
  throughputMode: efs.ThroughputMode.BURSTING,
  enableAutomaticBackups: true
});

const inst = new Instance(this, 'inst', {
  instanceType: InstanceType.of(InstanceClass.T2, InstanceSize.LARGE),
  machineImage: new AmazonLinuxImage({
    generation: AmazonLinuxGeneration.AMAZON_LINUX_2
  }),
  vpc,
  vpcSubnets: {
    subnetType: SubnetType.PUBLIC,
  }
});

fileSystem.connections.allowDefaultPortFrom(inst);

inst.userData.addCommands("yum check-update -y",    // Ubuntu: apt-get -y update
  "yum upgrade -y",                                 // Ubuntu: apt-get -y upgrade
  "yum install -y amazon-efs-utils",                // Ubuntu: apt-get -y install amazon-efs-utils
  "yum install -y nfs-utils",                       // Ubuntu: apt-get -y install nfs-common
  "file_system_id_1=" + fileSystem.fileSystemId,
  "efs_mount_point_1=/mnt/efs/fs1",
  "mkdir -p \"${efs_mount_point_1}\"",
  "test -f \"/sbin/mount.efs\" && echo \"${file_system_id_1}:/ ${efs_mount_point_1} efs defaults,_netdev\" >> /etc/fstab || " +
  "echo \"${file_system_id_1}.efs." + cdk.Stack.of(this).region + ".amazonaws.com:/ ${efs_mount_point_1} nfs4 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport,_netdev 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab",
  "mount -a -t efs,nfs4 defaults");
```
