/**
 * A collection of connected states
 *
 * A StateGraph is used to keep track of all states that are connected (have
 * transitions between them). It does not include the substatemachines in
 * a Parallel's branches: those are their own StateGraphs, but the graphs
 * themselves have a hierarchical relationship as well.
 *
 * By assigning states to a definitive StateGraph, we verify that no state
 * machines are constructed. In particular:
 *
 * - Every state object can only ever be in 1 StateGraph, and not inadvertently
 *   be used in two graphs.
 * - Every stateId must be unique across all states in the entire state
 *   machine.
 *
 * All policy statements in all states in all substatemachines are bubbled so
 * that the top-level StateMachine instantiation can read them all and add
 * them to the IAM Role.
 *
 * You do not need to instantiate this class; it is used internally.
