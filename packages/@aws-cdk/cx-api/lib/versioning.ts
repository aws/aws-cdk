// You need (and only need) to bump the CLOUD_ASSEMBLY_VERSION if the cloud
// assembly needs new features from the CDK CLI. Examples: new fields, new
// behavior, new artifact types.
//
// If that happens, you set the CLOUD_ASSEMBLY_VERSION to the *next* (not the
// current!) CDK version that will be released. This is done to produce
// useful error messages.
//
// When you do this, you will force users of a new library to upgrade the CLI
// (good), but UNLESS YOU ALSO IMPLEMENT 'upgradeAssemblyManifest' you will also
// force people who have installed a newer CLI to upgrade their libraries (bad!).
// Do that too, unless you have a very good reason not to.

/**
 * Bump this to the library version if and only if the CX protocol changes.
 *
 * We could also have used 1, 2, 3, ... here to indicate protocol versions, but
 * those then still need to be mapped to software versions to be useful. So we
 * might as well use the software version as protocol version and immediately
 * generate a useful error message from this.
 *
 * Note that the versions are not compared in a semver way, they are used as
 * opaque ordered tokens.
