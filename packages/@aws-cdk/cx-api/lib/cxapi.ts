 * might as well use the software version as protocol version and immediately
 * generate a useful error message from this.
 *
 * Note the following:
 *
 * - The versions are not compared in a semver way, they are used as
 *    opaque ordered tokens.
 * - The version needs to be set to the NEXT releasable version when it's
 *   updated (as the current verison in package.json has already been released!)
 * - The request does not have versioning yet, only the response.
