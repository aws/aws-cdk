// This file defines context keys that enable certain features that are

// existing apps. When a new app is initialized through `cdk init`, the CLI will
// automatically add enable these features by adding them to the generated
// `cdk.json` file.
//
// Some of these flags only affect the behavior of the construct library --
// these will be removed in the next major release and the behavior they are
// gating will become the only behavior.
//
// Other flags also affect the generated CloudFormation templates, in a way
// that prevents seamless upgrading. In the next major version, their
// behavior will become the default, but the flag still exists so users can
// switch it *off* in order to revert to the old behavior. These flags
// are marked with with the [PERMANENT] tag below.
