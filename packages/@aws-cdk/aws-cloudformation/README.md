### Custom Resources

Custom Resources are CloudFormation resources that are implemented by
arbitrary user code. They can do arbitrary lookups or modifications
during a CloudFormation synthesis run.

You will typically use Lambda to implement a Construct implemented as a
Custom Resource (though SNS topics can be used as well). Your Lambda function
will be sent a `CREATE`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` message, depending on the
CloudFormation life cycle, and can return any number of output values which
will be available as attributes of your Construct. In turn, those can
be used as input to other Constructs in your model.

In general, consumers of your Construct will not need to care whether
it is implemented in term of other CloudFormation resources or as a
custom resource.

Note: when implementing your Custom Resource using a Lambda, use
a `SingletonLambda` so that even if your custom resource is instantiated
multiple times, the Lambda will only get uploaded once.

#### Example

Sample of a Custom Resource that copies files into an S3 bucket during deployment
(implementation of actual `copy.py` operation elided).

```ts
interface CopyOperationProps {
  sourceBucket: IBucket;
  targetBucket: IBucket;
}

class CopyOperation extends Construct {
  constructor(parent: Construct, name: string, props: DemoResourceProps) {
    super(parent, name);

    const lambdaProvider = new SingletonLambda(this, 'Provider', {
      uuid: 'f7d4f730-4ee1-11e8-9c2d-fa7ae01bbebc',
      code: new LambdaInlineCode(resources['copy.py']),
      handler: 'index.handler',
      timeout: 60,
      runtime: LambdaRuntime.Python3,
    });

    new CustomResource(this, 'Resource', {
      provider: CustomResourceProvider.lambda(provider),
      properties: {
        sourceBucketArn: props.sourceBucket.bucketArn,
        targetBucketArn: props.targetBucket.bucketArn,
      }
    });
  }
}
```

More examples are in the `example` directory, including an example of how to use
the `cfnresponse` module that is provided for you by CloudFormation.
