/**
 * Renders a hashed ID for a resource.
 *
 * In order to make sure logical IDs are unique and stable, we hash the resource
 * construct tree path (i.e. toplevel/secondlevel/.../myresource) and add it as
 * a suffix to the path components joined without a separator (CloudFormation
 * IDs only allow alphanumeric characters).
 *
 * The result will be:
 *
 *     <path.join('')><md5(path.join('/')>
 *         "human"          "hash"
 *
 * If the "human" part of the ID exceeds 240 characters, we simply trim it so
 * the total ID doesn't exceed CloudFormation's 255 character limit.
 *
 * We only take 8 characters from the md5 hash (0.000005 chance of collision).
 *
 * Special cases:
 *
 * - If the path only contains a single component (i.e. it's a top-level
 *   resource), we won't add the hash to it. The hash is not needed for
 *   disamiguation and also, it allows for a more straightforward migration an
 *   existing CloudFormation template to a CDK stack without logical ID changes
 *   (or renames).
 * - For aesthetic reasons, if the last components of the path are the same
 *   (i.e. `L1/L2/Pipeline/Pipeline`), they will be de-duplicated to make the
 *   resulting human portion of the ID more pleasing: `L1L2Pipeline<HASH>`
 *   instead of `L1L2PipelinePipeline<HASH>`
 * - If a component is named "Default" it will be omitted from the path. This
 *   allows refactoring higher level abstractions around constructs without affecting
 *   the IDs of already deployed resources.
 * - If a component is named "Resource" it will be omitted from the user-visible
 *   path, but included in the hash. This reduces visual noise in the human readable
 *   part of the identifier.
