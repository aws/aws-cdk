/**
 * You can use intrinsic functions, such as ``Fn::If``, ``Fn::Equals``, and ``Fn::Not``, to conditionally
 * create stack resources. These conditions are evaluated based on input parameters that you
 * declare when you create or update a stack. After you define all your conditions, you can
 * associate them with resources or resource properties in the Resources and Outputs sections
 * of a template.
 *
 * You define all conditions in the Conditions section of a template except for ``Fn::If`` conditions.
 * You can use the ``Fn::If`` condition in the metadata attribute, update policy attribute, and property
 * values in the Resources section and Outputs sections of a template.
 *
 * You might use conditions when you want to reuse a template that can create resources in different
 * contexts, such as a test environment versus a production environment. In your template, you can
 * add an EnvironmentType input parameter, which accepts either prod or test as inputs. For the
 * production environment, you might include Amazon EC2 instances with certain capabilities;
 * however, for the test environment, you want to use less capabilities to save costs. With
 * conditions, you can define which resources are created and how they're configured for each
 * environment type.
