 * Work with secret values in the CDK

 * secret values directly into a CloudFormation template, constructs that take
 * secret values will not allow you to pass in a literal secret value. They do
 * so by calling `Secret.assertSafeSecret()`.
 *
 * You can escape the check by calling `Secret.plainTex()`, but doing
 * so is highly discouraged.
