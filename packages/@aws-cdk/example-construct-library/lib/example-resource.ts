/**
 * The interface that represents the ExampleResource resource.
 * We always use an interface, because each L2 resource type in the CDK can occur in two aspects:
 *
 *   1. It can be a resource that's created and managed by the CDK.
 *     Those resources are represented by the class with the name identical to the resource -
 *     {@link ExampleResource} in our case, which implements {@link IExampleResource}.
 *   2. It can be a resource that exists already, and is not managed by the CDK code,
 *     but needs to be referenced in your infrastructure definition code.
 *     Those kinds of instances are returned from static `fromXyz(Name/Arn/Attributes)` methods -
 *     in our case, the {@link ExampleResource.fromExampleResourceName} method.
 *     In general, those kinds of resources do not allow any sort of mutating operations to be performed on them
 *     (the exception is when they can be changed by creating a different resource -
 *     IAM Roles, which you can attach multiple IAM Policies to,
 *     are the canonical example of this sort of resource),
 *     as they are not part of the CloudFormation stack that is created by the CDK.
 *
 *  So, an interface like {@link IExampleResource} represents a resource that *might* be mutable,
 *  while the {@link ExampleResource} class represents a resource that definitely is mutable.
 *  Whenever a type that represents this resource needs to referenced in other code,
 *  you want to use {@link IExampleResource} as the type, not {@link ExampleResource}.
 *
 *  The interface for the resource should have at least 2 (readonly) properties
 *  that represent the ARN and the physical name of the resource -
 *  in our example, those are {@link exampleResourceArn} and {@link exampleResourceName}.
 *
 *  The interface defines the behaviors the resource exhibits.
 *  Common behaviors are:
 *    - {@link addToRolePolicy} for resources that are tied to an IAM Role
 *    - grantXyz() methods (represented by {@link grantRead} in this example)
 *    - onXyz() CloudWatch Events methods (represented by {@link onEvent} in this example)
 *    - metricXyz() CloudWatch Metric methods (represented by {@link metricCount} in this example)
 *
 *  Of course, other behaviors are possible -
 *  it all depends on the capabilities of the underlying resource that is being modeled.
 *
 *  This interface must always extend the IResource interface from the core module.
 *  It can also extend some other common interfaces that add various default behaviors -
 *  some examples are shown below.
