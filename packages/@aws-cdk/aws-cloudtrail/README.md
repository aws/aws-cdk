Add a CloudTrail construct - for ease of setting up CloudTrail logging in your account

Example usage:

```ts
import cloudtrail = require('@aws-cdk/aws-cloudtrail');

const trail = new cloudtrail.Trail(this, 'CloudTrail');
```

You can instantiate the CloudTrail construct with no arguments - this will by default:
    * Create a new S3 Bucket and associated Policy that allows CloudTrail to write to it
    * Create a CloudTrail with the following configuration:
        * Logging Enabled
        * Log file validation enabled
        * Multi Region set to true
        * Global Service Events set to true
        * The created S3 bucket
        * CloudWatch Logging Disabled
        * No SNS configuartion
        * No tags
        * No fixed name

You can override any of these properties using the `CloudTrailProps` configuraiton object.

For example, to log to CloudWatch Logs

```ts

import cloudtrail = require('@aws-cdk/aws-cloudtrail');

const trail = new cloudtrail.Trail(this, 'CloudTrail', {
  sendToCloudWatchLogs: true
});
```

This creates the same setup as above - but also logs events to a created CloudWatch Log stream.
By default, the created log group has a retention period of 365 Days, but this is also configurable.

For using CloudTrail event selector to log specific S3 events,
you can use the `CloudTrailProps` configuration object.
Example:

```ts
import cloudtrail = require('@aws-cdk/aws-cloudtrail');

const trail = new cloudtrail.Trail(this, 'MyAmazingCloudTrail');

// Adds an event selector to the bucket magic-bucket.
// By default, this includes management events and all operations (Read + Write)
trail.addS3EventSelector(["arn:aws:s3:::magic-bucket/"]);

// Adds an event selector to the bucket foo, with a specific configuration
trail.addS3EventSelector(["arn:aws:s3:::foo/"], {
  includeManagementEvents: false,
  readWriteType: ReadWriteType.All,
});
```
