This library contains integration classes to send AWS CloudWatch Events to any
number of supported AWS Services. Instances of these classes should be passed
to the `rule.addTarget()` method.

Currently supported are:

* Start a CodeBuild build
* Start a CodePipeline pipeline
* Run an ECS task
* Invoke a Lambda function
* Publish a message to an SNS topic
* Send a message to an SQS queue
* Start a StepFunctions state machine
* Make an AWS API call

See the README of the `@aws-cdk/aws-events` library for more information on
CloudWatch Events.
