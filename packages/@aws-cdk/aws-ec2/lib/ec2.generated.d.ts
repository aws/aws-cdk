 * [EC2-VPC only] Adds the specified egress rules to a security group for use with a VPC.
 *
 * An outbound rule permits instances to send traffic to the specified destination IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR address ranges, or to the specified destination security groups for the same VPC.
 *
 * You specify a protocol for each rule (for example, TCP). For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or port range. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. You can use -1 for the type or code to mean all types or all codes.
 *
 * You must specify only one of the following properties: `CidrIp` , `CidrIpv6` , `DestinationPrefixListId` , or `DestinationSecurityGroupId` .
 *
 * You must specify a destination security group ( `DestinationPrefixListId` or `DestinationSecurityGroupId` ) or a CIDR range ( `CidrIp` or `CidrIpv6` ). If you do not specify one of these parameters, the stack will launch successfully but the rule will not be added to the security group.
 *
 * Rule changes are propagated to affected instances as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.
 *
 * For more information about VPC security group limits, see [Amazon VPC Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html) .
 *
 * Use `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress` and `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupEgress` only when necessary, typically to allow security groups to reference each other in ingress and egress rules. Otherwise, use the embedded ingress and egress rules of the security group. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) .

 *
 * The Spot Fleet request specifies the total target capacity and the On-Demand target capacity. Amazon EC2 calculates the difference between the total capacity and On-Demand capacity, and launches the difference as Spot capacity.
 *
 * You can submit a single request that includes multiple launch specifications that vary by instance type, AMI, Availability Zone, or subnet.
 *
 * By default, the Spot Fleet requests Spot Instances in the Spot Instance pool where the price per unit is the lowest. Each launch specification can include its own instance weighting that reflects the value of the instance type to your application workload.
 *
 * Alternatively, you can specify that the Spot Fleet distribute the target capacity across the Spot pools included in its launch specifications. By ensuring that the Spot Instances in your Spot Fleet are in different Spot pools, you can improve the availability of your fleet.
 *
 * You can specify tags for the Spot Fleet request and instances launched by the fleet. You cannot tag other resource types in a Spot Fleet request because only the `spot-fleet-request` and `instance` resource types are supported.
 *
 * For more information, see [Spot Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .

         *
         * - **priceCapacityOptimized (recommended)** - Spot Fleet identifies the pools with the highest capacity availability for the number of instances that are launching. This means that we will request Spot Instances from the pools that we believe have the lowest chance of interruption in the near term. Spot Fleet then requests Spot Instances from the lowest priced of these pools.
         * - **capacityOptimized** - Spot Fleet identifies the pools with the highest capacity availability for the number of instances that are launching. This means that we will request Spot Instances from the pools that we believe have the lowest chance of interruption in the near term. To give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use `capacityOptimizedPrioritized` . Set a priority for each instance type by using the `Priority` parameter for `LaunchTemplateOverrides` . You can assign the same priority to different `LaunchTemplateOverrides` . EC2 implements the priorities on a best-effort basis, but optimizes for capacity first. `capacityOptimizedPrioritized` is supported only if your Spot Fleet uses a launch template. Note that if the `OnDemandAllocationStrategy` is set to `prioritized` , the same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity.
         * - **diversified** - Spot Fleet requests instances from all of the Spot Instance pools that you specify.
         * - **lowestPrice** - Spot Fleet requests instances from the lowest priced Spot Instance pool that has available capacity. If the lowest priced pool doesn't have available capacity, the Spot Instances come from the next lowest priced pool that has available capacity. If a pool runs out of capacity before fulfilling your desired capacity, Spot Fleet will continue to fulfill your request by drawing from the next lowest priced pool. To ensure that your desired capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several pools. Because this strategy only considers instance price and not capacity availability, it might lead to high interruption rates.

 *
 * Amazon EBS does not support sizing down an Amazon EBS volume. AWS CloudFormation does not attempt to modify an Amazon EBS volume to a smaller size on rollback.
 *
 * Some common scenarios when you might encounter a cooldown period for Amazon EBS include:
 *
 * - You successfully update an Amazon EBS volume and the update succeeds. When you attempt another update within the cooldown window, that update will be subject to a cooldown period.
 * - You successfully update an Amazon EBS volume and the update succeeds but another change in your `update-stack` call fails. The rollback will be subject to a cooldown period.

 * For more information on the cooldown period, see [Requirements when modifying volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/modify-volume-requirements.html) .
 *
 * *DeletionPolicy attribute*
 *
 * To control how AWS CloudFormation handles the volume when the stack is deleted, set a deletion policy for your volume.
