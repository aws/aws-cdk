## AWS Compute and Networking Construct Library

The `@aws-cdk/aws-ec2` package contains primitives for setting up networking,
instances, and load balancers.

### VPC

Most projects need a Virtual Private Cloud to provide security by means of
network partitioning. This is easily achieved by creating an instance of
`VpcNetwork`:

```ts
import ec2 = require('@aws-cdk/aws-ec2');

const vpc = new ec2.VpcNetwork(this, 'VPC');
```

All default Constructs requires EC2 instances to be launched inside a VPC, so
you should generally start by defining a VPC whenever you need to launch
instances for your project.

Our default `VpcNetwork` class creates a private and public subnet for every
availability zone. Classes that use the VPC will generally launch instances
into all private subnets, and provide a parameter called `vpcPlacement` to
allow you to override the placement. [Read more about
subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html).


#### Advanced Subnet Configuration
If you require the ability to configure subnets the `VpcNetwork` can be
customized with `SubnetConfiguration` array. This is best explained by an
example:

```ts
import ec2 = require('@aws-cdk/aws-ec2');

const vpc = new ec2.VpcNetwork(stack, 'TheVPC', {
  cidr: '10.0.0.0/21',
  subnetConfiguration: [
    {
      cidrMask: 24,
      name: 'Ingress',
      subnetType: SubnetType.Public,
      natGateway: true,
    },
    {
      cidrMask: 24,
      name: 'Application',
      subnetType: SubnetType.Private,
    },
    {
      cidrMask: 28,
      name: 'Database',
      subnetType: SubnetType.Isolated,
    }
  ],
});
```

The example above is one possible configuration, but the user can use the
constructs above to implement many other network configurations.

The `VpcNetwork` from the above configuration in a Region with three
availability zones will be the following:
 * IngressSubnet1: 10.0.0.0/24
 * IngressSubnet2: 10.0.1.0/24
 * IngressSubnet3: 10.0.2.0/24
 * ApplicationSubnet1: 10.0.3.0/24
 * ApplicationSubnet2: 10.0.4.0/24
 * ApplicationSubnet3: 10.0.5.0/24
 * DatabaseSubnet1: 10.0.6.0/28
 * DatabaseSubnet2: 10.0.6.16/28
 * DatabaseSubnet3: 10.0.6.32/28

Each `Public` Subnet will have a NAT Gateway. Each `Private` Subnet will have a
route to the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone. Each `Isolated` subnet
will not have a route to the internet, but is routeable inside the VPC. The
numbers [1-3] will consistently map to availability zones (e.g. IngressSubnet1
and ApplicationSubnet1 will be in the same avialbility zone).

`Isolated` Subnets provide simplified secure networking principles, but come at
an operational complexity. The lack of an internet route means that if you deploy
instances in this subnet you will not be able to patch from the internet, this is
commonly reffered to as
[fully baked images](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/configuration-management/aws-ami-design/).
Features such as
[cfn-signal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-signal.html)
are also unavailable. Using these subnets for managed services (RDS,
Elasticache, Redshift) is a very practical use because the managed services do
not incur additional operational overhead.

Many times when you plan to build an application you don't know how many
instances of the application you will need and therefore you don't know how much
IP space to allocate. For example, you know the application will only have
Elastic Loadbalancers in the public subnets and you know you will have 1-3 RDS
databases for your data tier, and the rest of the IP space should just be evenly
distributed for the application.

```ts
import ec2 = require('@aws-cdk/aws-ec2');

const vpc = new ec2.VpcNetwork(stack, 'TheVPC', {
  cidr: '10.0.0.0/16',
  subnetConfiguration: [
    {
      cidrMask: 26,
      name: 'Public',
      subnetType: SubnetType.Public,
      natGateway: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'Application',
      subnetType: SubnetType.Private,
    },
    {
      cidrMask: 27,
      name: 'Database',
      subnetType: SubnetType.Isolated,
    }
  ],
});
```

The `VpcNetwork` from the above configuration in a Region with three
availability zones will be the following:
 * PublicSubnet1: 10.0.0.0/26
 * PublicSubnet2: 10.0.0.64/26
 * PublicSubnet3: 10.0.2.128/26
 * DatabaseSubnet1: 10.0.0.192/27
 * DatabaseSubnet2: 10.0.0.224/27
 * DatabaseSubnet3: 10.0.1.0/27
 * ApplicationSubnet1: 10.0.64.0/18
 * ApplicationSubnet2: 10.0.128.0/18
 * ApplicationSubnet3: 10.0.192.0/18

Any subnet configuration without a `cidrMask` will be counted up and allocated
evenly across the remaining IP space.

Teams may also become cost conscious and be willing to trade availability for
cost. For example, in your test environments perhaps you would like the same VPC
as production, but instead of 3 NAT Gateways you would like only 1. This will
save on the cost, but trade the 3 availability zone to a 1 for all egress
traffic. This can be accomplished with a single parameter configuration:

```ts
import ec2 = require('@aws-cdk/aws-ec2');

const vpc = new ec2.VpcNetwork(stack, 'TheVPC', {
  cidr: '10.0.0.0/16',
  natGateways: 1,
  subnetConfiguration: [
    {
      cidrMask: 26,
      name: 'Public',
      subnetType: SubnetType.Public,
      natGateway: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'Application',
      subnetType: SubnetType.Private,
    },
    {
      cidrMask: 27,
      name: 'Database',
      subnetType: SubnetType.Isolated,
    }
  ],
});
```

The `VpcNetwork` above will have the exact same subnet definitions as listed
above. However, this time the VPC will have only 1 NAT Gateway and all
Application subnets will route to the NAT Gateway.


### Load Balancer

Load balancers send traffic to one or more fleets. Create a load balancer,
set up listeners and a health check, and supply the fleet(s) you want to load
balance to in the `targets` property.

The load balancer allows all connections by default. If you want to change that,
pass the `allowConnectionsFrom` property while setting up the listener.

```ts
new ec2.ClassicLoadBalancer(stack, 'LB', {
    vpc,
    internetFacing: true,
    listeners: [{
        externalPort: 80,
    }],
    healthCheck: {
        port: 80
    },
    targets: [fleet]
});
```

### Allowing Connections

In AWS, all connections to and from EC2 instances are governed by *Security
Groups*. You can think of these as a firewall with rules. All Constructs that
create instances on your behalf implicitly have such a security group.
Unless otherwise indicated using properites, the security groups start out
empty; that is, no connections are allowed by default.

In general, whenever you link two Constructs together (such as the load balancer and the
fleet in the previous example), the security groups will be automatically updated to allow
network connections between the indicated instances. In other cases, you will need to
configure these allows connections yourself, for example if the connections you want to
allow do not originate from instances in a CDK construct, or if you want to allow
connections among instances inside a single security group.

All Constructs with security groups have a member called `connections`, which
can be used to configure permissible connections. In the most general case, a
call to allow connections needs both a connection peer and the type of
connection to allow:

```ts
lb.connections.allowFrom(new ec2.AnyIPv4(), new ec2.TcpPort(443), 'Allow inbound');

// Or using a convenience function
lb.connections.allowFromAnyIpv4(new ec2.TcpPort(443), 'Allow inbound');
```

### Connection Peers

There are various classes that implement the connection peer part:

```ts
// Simple connection peers
let peer = new ec2.CidrIp("10.0.0.0/16");
let peer = new ec2.AnyIPv4();
let peer = new ec2.CidrIpv6("::0/0");
let peer = new ec2.AnyIPv6();
let peer = new ec2.PrefixList("pl-12345");
fleet.connections.allowTo(peer, new ec2.TcpPort(443), 'Allow outbound HTTPS');
```

Any object that has a security group can itself be used as a connection peer:

```ts
// These automatically create appropriate ingress and egress rules in both security groups
fleet1.connections.allowTo(fleet2, new ec2.TcpPort(80), 'Allow between fleets');

fleet.connections.allowTcpPort(80), 'Allow from load balancer');
```

### Port Ranges

The connections that are allowed are specified by port ranges. A number of classes provide
the connection specifier:

```ts
new ec2.TcpPort(80);
new ec2.TcpPortRange(60000, 65535);
new ec2.TcpAllPorts();
new ec2.AllConnections();
```

> NOTE: This set is not complete yet; for example, there is no library support for ICMP at the moment.
> However, you can write your own classes to implement those.

### Default Ports

Some Constructs have default ports associated with them. For example, the
listener of a load balancer does (it's the public port), or instances of an
RDS database (it's the port the database is accepting connections on).

If the object you're calling the peering method on has a default port associated with it, you can call
`allowDefaultPortFrom()` and omit the port specifier. If the argument has an associated default port, call
`allowToDefaultPort()`.

For example:

```ts
// Port implicit in listener
listener.connections.allowDefaultPortFromAnyIpv4('Allow public');

// Port implicit in peer
fleet.connections.allowToDefaultPort(rdsDatabase, 'Fleet can access database');
```
