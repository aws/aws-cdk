## Introduction

Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket
APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud.
As an API Gateway API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Read the
[Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html).

This module supports features under [API Gateway v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_ApiGatewayV2.html)
that lets users set up Websocket and HTTP APIs.
REST APIs can be created using the `@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway` module.

## HTTP API

HTTP APIs enable creation of RESTful APIs that integrate with AWS Lambda functions, known as Lambda proxy integration,
or to any routable HTTP endpoint, known as HTTP proxy integration.

### Defining HTTP APIs

HTTP APIs have two fundamental concepts - Routes and Integrations.

Routes direct incoming API requests to backend resources. Routes consist of two parts: an HTTP method and a resource
path, such as, `GET /books`. Learn more at [Working with
routes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-routes.html). Use the `ANY` method
to match any methods for a route that are not explicitly defined.

Integrations define how the HTTP API responds when a client reaches a specific Route. HTTP APIs support Lambda proxy
integration, HTTP proxy integration and, AWS service integrations, also known as private integrations. Learn more at
[Configuring integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations.html).

Integrations are available at the `aws-apigatewayv2-integrations` module and more information is available in that module.
As an early example, the following code snippet configures a route `GET /books` with an HTTP proxy integration all
configures all other HTTP method calls to `/books` to a lambda proxy.

```ts
const getBooksIntegration = new HttpProxyIntegration({
  url: 'https://get-books-proxy.myproxy.internal',
});

const booksDefaultFn = new lambda.Function(stack, 'BooksDefaultFn', { ... });
const booksDefaultIntegration = new LambdaProxyIntegration({
  handler: booksDefaultFn,
});

const httpApi = new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpApi');

httpApi.addRoutes({
  path: '/books',
  methods: [ HttpMethod.GET ],
  integration: getBooksIntegration,
});
httpApi.addRoutes({
  path: '/books',
  methods: [ HttpMethod.ANY ],
  integration: booksDefaultIntegration,
});
```

The URL to the endpoint can be retrieved via the `apiEndpoint` attribute. By default this URL is enabled for clients. Use `disableExecuteApiEndpoint` to disable it.

```ts
const httpApi = new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpApi', {
  disableExecuteApiEndpoint: true,
});
```

The `defaultIntegration` option while defining HTTP APIs lets you create a default catch-all integration that is
matched when a client reaches a route that is not explicitly defined.

```ts
new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpProxyApi', {
  defaultIntegration: new HttpProxyIntegration({
    url:'http://example.com',
  }),
});
```

### Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is a browser security
feature that restricts HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser. Enabling CORS will allow
requests to your API from a web application hosted in a domain different from your API domain.

When configured CORS for an HTTP API, API Gateway automatically sends a response to preflight `OPTIONS` requests, even
if there isn't an `OPTIONS` route configured. Note that, when this option is used, API Gateway will ignore CORS headers
returned from your backend integration. Learn more about [Configuring CORS for an HTTP
API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-cors.html).

The `corsPreflight` option lets you specify a CORS configuration for an API.

```ts
new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpProxyApi', {
  corsPreflight: {
    allowHeaders: ['Authorization'],
    allowMethods: [HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.HEAD, HttpMethod.OPTIONS, HttpMethod.POST],
    allowOrigins: ['*'],
    maxAge: Duration.days(10),
  },
});
```

### Publishing HTTP APIs

A Stage is a logical reference to a lifecycle state of your API (for example, `dev`, `prod`, `beta`, or `v2`). API
stages are identified by their stage name. Each stage is a named reference to a deployment of the API made available for
client applications to call.

Use `HttpStage` to create a Stage resource for HTTP APIs. The following code sets up a Stage, whose URL is available at
`https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/beta`.

```ts
new HttpStage(stack, 'Stage', {
  httpApi: api,
  stageName: 'beta',
});
```

If you omit the `stageName` will create a `$default` stage. A `$default` stage is one that is served from the base of
the API's URL - `https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/`.

Note that, `HttpApi` will always creates a `$default` stage, unless the `createDefaultStage` property is unset.

### Custom Domain

Custom domain names are simpler and more intuitive URLs that you can provide to your API users. Custom domain name are associated to API stages.

The code snippet below creates a custom domain and configures a default domain mapping for your API that maps the
custom domain to the `$default` stage of the API.

```ts
const certArn = 'arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:111111111111:certificate';
const domainName = 'example.com';

const dn = new DomainName(stack, 'DN', {
  domainName,
  certificate: acm.Certificate.fromCertificateArn(stack, 'cert', certArn),
});

const api = new HttpApi(stack, 'HttpProxyProdApi', {
  defaultIntegration: new LambdaProxyIntegration({ handler }),
  // https://${dn.domainName}/foo goes to prodApi $default stage
  defaultDomainMapping: {
    domainName: dn,
    mappingKey: 'foo',
  },
});
```

To associate a specifc `Stage` to a custom domain mapping -

```ts
api.addStage('beta', {
  stageName: 'beta',
  autoDeploy: true,
  // https://${dn.domainName}/bar goes to the beta stage
  domainMapping: {
    domainName: dn,
    mappingKey: 'bar',
  },
});
```

The same domain name can be associated with stages across different `HttpApi` as so -

```ts
const apiDemo = new HttpApi(stack, 'DemoApi', {
  defaultIntegration: new LambdaProxyIntegration({ handler }),
  // https://${dn.domainName}/demo goes to apiDemo $default stage
  defaultDomainMapping: {
    domainName: dn,
    mappingKey: 'demo',
  },
});
```

The `mappingKey` determines the base path of the URL with the custom domain. Each custom domain is only allowed
to have one API mapping with undefined `mappingKey`. If more than one API mappings are specified, `mappingKey` will be required for all of them. In the sample above, the custom domain is associated
with 3 API mapping resources across different APIs and Stages.

|        API     |     Stage   |   URL  |
| :------------: | :---------: | :----: |
| api | $default  |   `https://${domainName}/foo`  |
| api | beta  |   `https://${domainName}/bar`  |
| apiDemo | $default  |   `https://${domainName}/demo`  |

### Managing access

API Gateway supports multiple mechanisms for [controlling and managing access to your HTTP
API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-access-control.html) through authorizers.

These authorizers can be found in the [APIGatewayV2-Authorizers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-apigatewayv2-authorizers-readme.html) constructs library.

### Metrics

The API Gateway v2 service sends metrics around the performance of HTTP APIs to Amazon CloudWatch.
These metrics can be referred to using the metric APIs available on the `HttpApi` construct.
The APIs with the `metric` prefix can be used to get reference to specific metrics for this API. For example,
the method below refers to the client side errors metric for this API.

```ts
const api = new apigw.HttpApi(stack, 'my-api');
const clientErrorMetric = api.metricClientError();
```

Please note that this will return a metric for all the stages defined in the api. It is also possible to refer to metrics for a specific Stage using
the `metric` methods from the `Stage` construct.

```ts
const api = new apigw.HttpApi(stack, 'my-api');
const stage = new HttpStage(stack, 'Stage', {
   httpApi: api,
});
const clientErrorMetric = stage.metricClientError();
```

### VPC Link

Private integrations let HTTP APIs connect with AWS resources that are placed behind a VPC. These are usually Application
Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or a Cloud Map service. The `VpcLink` construct enables this integration.
The following code creates a `VpcLink` to a private VPC.

```ts
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(stack, 'VPC');
const vpcLink = new VpcLink(stack, 'VpcLink', { vpc });
```

Any existing `VpcLink` resource can be imported into the CDK app via the `VpcLink.fromVpcLinkId()`.

```ts
const awesomeLink = VpcLink.fromVpcLinkId(stack, 'awesome-vpc-link', 'us-east-1_oiuR12Abd');
```

### Private Integration

Private integrations enable integrating an HTTP API route with private resources in a VPC, such as Application Load Balancers or
Amazon ECS container-based applications.  Using private integrations, resources in a VPC can be exposed for access by
clients outside of the VPC.

These integrations can be found in the [APIGatewayV2-Integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations-readme.html) constructs library.

## WebSocket API

A WebSocket API in API Gateway is a collection of WebSocket routes that are integrated with backend HTTP endpoints, 
Lambda functions, or other AWS services. You can use API Gateway features to help you with all aspects of the API 
lifecycle, from creation through monitoring your production APIs. [Read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api-overview.html)

WebSocket APIs have two fundamental concepts - Routes and Integrations.

WebSocket APIs direct JSON messages to backend integrations based on configured routes. (Non-JSON messages are directed 
to the configured `$default` route.)

Integrations define how the WebSocket API behaves when a client reaches a specific Route. Learn more at
[Configuring integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api-integration-requests.html).

Integrations are available in the `aws-apigatewayv2-integrations` module and more information is available in that module.

To add the default WebSocket routes supported by API Gateway (`$connect`, `$disconnect` and `$default`), configure them as part of api props:

```ts
const webSocketApi = new WebSocketApi(stack, 'mywsapi', {
  connectRouteOptions: { integration: new LambdaWebSocketIntegration({ handler: connectHandler }) },
  disconnectRouteOptions: { integration: new LambdaWebSocketIntegration({ handler: disconnetHandler }) },
  defaultRouteOptions: { integration: new LambdaWebSocketIntegration({ handler: defaultHandler }) },
});

new WebSocketStage(stack, 'mystage', {
  webSocketApi,
  stageName: 'dev',
  autoDeploy: true,
});
```

To add any other route:

```ts
const webSocketApi = new WebSocketApi(stack, 'mywsapi');
webSocketApi.addRoute('sendmessage', {
  integration: new LambdaWebSocketIntegration({
    handler: messageHandler,
  }),
});
```
