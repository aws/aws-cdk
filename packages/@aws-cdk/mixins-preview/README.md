This package provides two main features:

1. **Mixins** - Composable abstractions for adding functionality to constructs
2. **EventBridge Event Patterns** - Type-safe event patterns for AWS resources

---

## CDK Mixins

CDK Mixins provide a new, advanced way to add functionality through composable abstractions.
Unlike traditional L2 constructs that bundle all features together, Mixins allow you to pick and choose exactly the capabilities you need for constructs.

### Key Benefits

* **Universal Compatibility**: Apply the same abstractions to L1 constructs, L2 constructs, or custom constructs
* **Composable Design**: Mix and match features without being locked into specific implementations  
* **Cross-Service Abstractions**: Use common patterns like encryption across different AWS services
* **Escape Hatch Freedom**: Customize resources in a safe, typed way while keeping the abstractions you want

### Basic Usage

Mixins use `Mixins.of()` as the fundamental API for applying abstractions to constructs:

```typescript
// Base form: apply mixins to any construct
const bucket = new s3.CfnBucket(scope, "MyBucket");
Mixins.of(bucket)
  .apply(new EncryptionAtRest())
  .apply(new AutoDeleteObjects());
```

#### Fluent Syntax with `.with()`

For convenience, you can use the `.with()` method for a more fluent syntax:

```typescript
import '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/with';

const bucket = new s3.CfnBucket(scope, "MyBucket")
  .with(new BucketVersioning())
  .with(new AutoDeleteObjects());
```

The `.with()` method is available after importing `@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/with`, which augments all constructs with this method. It provides the same functionality as `Mixins.of().apply()` but with a more chainable API.

> **Note**: The `.with()` fluent syntax is only available in JavaScript and TypeScript. Other jsii languages (Python, Java, C#, and Go) should use the `Mixins.of(...).requireAll()` syntax instead. The import requirement is temporary during the preview phase. Once the API is stable, the `.with()` method will be available by default on all constructs and in all languages.

### Creating Custom Mixins

Mixins are simple classes that implement the `IMixin` interface (usually by extending the abstract `Mixin` class:

```typescript
// Simple mixin that enables versioning
class CustomVersioningMixin extends Mixin implements IMixin {
  supports(construct: any): boolean {
    return construct instanceof s3.CfnBucket;
  }

  applyTo(bucket: any): void {
    bucket.versioningConfiguration = {
      status: "Enabled"
    };
  }
}

// Usage
const bucket = new s3.CfnBucket(scope, "MyBucket");
Mixins.of(bucket).apply(new CustomVersioningMixin());
```

### Construct Selection

Mixins operate on construct trees and can be applied selectively:

```typescript
// Apply to all constructs in a scope
Mixins.of(scope).apply(new EncryptionAtRest());

// Apply to specific resource types
Mixins.of(scope, ConstructSelector.resourcesOfType(s3.CfnBucket.CFN_RESOURCE_TYPE_NAME))
  .apply(new EncryptionAtRest());

// Apply to constructs matching a path pattern
Mixins.of(scope, ConstructSelector.byPath("**/*-prod-*/**"))
  .apply(new ProductionSecurityMixin());
```

### Built-in Mixins

#### Cross-Service Mixins

**EncryptionAtRest**: Applies encryption to supported AWS resources

```typescript
// Works across different resource types
const bucket = new s3.CfnBucket(scope, "Bucket");
Mixins.of(bucket).apply(new EncryptionAtRest());

const logGroup = new logs.CfnLogGroup(scope, "LogGroup");
Mixins.of(logGroup).apply(new EncryptionAtRest());
```

#### S3-Specific Mixins

**AutoDeleteObjects**: Configures automatic object deletion for S3 buckets

```typescript
const bucket = new s3.CfnBucket(scope, "Bucket");
Mixins.of(bucket).apply(new AutoDeleteObjects());
```

**BucketVersioning**: Enables versioning on S3 buckets

```typescript
const bucket = new s3.CfnBucket(scope, "Bucket");
Mixins.of(bucket).apply(new BucketVersioning());
```

**BucketBlockPublicAccess**: Enables blocking public-access on S3 buckets

```typescript
const bucket = new s3.CfnBucket(scope, "Bucket");
Mixins.of(bucket).apply(new BucketBlockPublicAccess());
```

**BucketPolicyStatementsMixin**: Adds IAM policy statements to a bucket policy

```typescript
declare const bucket: s3.IBucketRef;

const bucketPolicy = new s3.CfnBucketPolicy(scope, "BucketPolicy", {
  bucket: bucket,
  policyDocument: new iam.PolicyDocument(),
});
Mixins.of(bucketPolicy).apply(new BucketPolicyStatementsMixin([
  new iam.PolicyStatement({
    actions: ["s3:GetObject"],
    resources: ["*"],
    principals: [new iam.AnyPrincipal()],
  }),
]));
```

### Logs Delivery

Configures vended logs delivery for supported resources to various destinations:

```typescript
import '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/with';
import * as cloudfrontMixins from '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/aws-cloudfront/mixins';

// Create CloudFront distribution
declare const bucket: s3.Bucket;
const distribution = new cloudfront.Distribution(scope, 'Distribution', {
  defaultBehavior: {
    origin: origins.S3BucketOrigin.withOriginAccessControl(bucket),
  },
});

// Create log destination
const logGroup = new logs.LogGroup(scope, 'DeliveryLogGroup');

// Configure log delivery using the mixin
distribution
  .with(cloudfrontMixins.CfnDistributionLogsMixin.CONNECTION_LOGS.toLogGroup(logGroup));
```

Configures vended logs delivery for supported resources when a pre-created destination is provided:

```typescript
import '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/with';
import * as cloudfrontMixins from '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/aws-cloudfront/mixins';

// Create CloudFront distribution
declare const bucket: s3.Bucket;
const distribution = new cloudfront.Distribution(scope, 'Distribution', {
  defaultBehavior: {
    origin: origins.S3BucketOrigin.withOriginAccessControl(bucket),
  },
});

// Create destination bucket
const destBucket = new s3.Bucket(scope, 'DeliveryBucket');
// Add permissions to bucket to facilitate log delivery
const bucketPolicy = new s3.BucketPolicy(scope, 'DeliveryBucketPolicy', {
  bucket: destBucket,
  document: new iam.PolicyDocument(),
});
// Create S3 delivery destination for logs
const destination = new logs.CfnDeliveryDestination(scope, 'Destination', {
  destinationResourceArn: destBucket.bucketArn,
  name: 'unique-destination-name',
  deliveryDestinationType: 'S3',
});

distribution
  .with(cloudfrontMixins.CfnDistributionLogsMixin.CONNECTION_LOGS.toDestination(destination));
```

### L1 Property Mixins

For every CloudFormation resource, CDK Mixins automatically generates type-safe property mixins. These allow you to apply L1 properties with full TypeScript support:

```typescript
import '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/with';


const bucket = new s3.Bucket(scope, "Bucket")
  .with(new CfnBucketPropsMixin({
    versioningConfiguration: { status: "Enabled" },
    publicAccessBlockConfiguration: {
      blockPublicAcls: true,
      blockPublicPolicy: true
    }
  }));
```

Property mixins support two merge strategies:

```typescript
declare const bucket: s3.CfnBucket;

// MERGE (default): Deep merges properties with existing values
Mixins.of(bucket).apply(new CfnBucketPropsMixin(
  { versioningConfiguration: { status: "Enabled" } },
  { strategy: PropertyMergeStrategy.MERGE }
));

// OVERRIDE: Replaces existing property values
Mixins.of(bucket).apply(new CfnBucketPropsMixin(
  { versioningConfiguration: { status: "Enabled" } },
  { strategy: PropertyMergeStrategy.OVERRIDE }
));
```

Property mixins are available for all AWS services:

```typescript
import { CfnLogGroupPropsMixin } from '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/aws-logs/mixins';
import { CfnFunctionPropsMixin } from '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/aws-lambda/mixins';
import { CfnTablePropsMixin } from '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/aws-dynamodb/mixins';
```

### Error Handling

Mixins provide comprehensive error handling:

```typescript
// Graceful handling of unsupported constructs
Mixins.of(scope)
  .apply(new EncryptionAtRest()); // Skips unsupported constructs

// Strict application that requires all constructs to match
Mixins.of(scope)
  .requireAll() // Throws if no constructs support the mixin
  .apply(new EncryptionAtRest());
```

## EventBridge Event Patterns

CDK Mixins automatically generates typed EventBridge event patterns for AWS resources. These patterns work with both L1 and L2 constructs, providing a consistent interface for creating EventBridge rules.

### Event Patterns Basic Usage

```typescript
import { BucketEvents } from '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/aws-s3/events';
import * as events from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-events';
import * as targets from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-events-targets';

// Works with L2 constructs
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(scope, 'Bucket');
const bucketEvents = BucketEvents.fromBucket(bucket);
declare const fn: lambda.Function;

new events.Rule(scope, 'Rule', {
  eventPattern: bucketEvents.objectCreatedPattern({
    object: { key: events.Match.wildcard('uploads/*') },
  }),
  targets: [new targets.LambdaFunction(fn)]
});

// Also works with L1 constructs
const cfnBucket = new s3.CfnBucket(scope, 'CfnBucket');
const cfnBucketEvents = BucketEvents.fromBucket(cfnBucket);

new events.CfnRule(scope, 'CfnRule', {
  state: 'ENABLED',
  eventPattern: cfnBucketEvents.objectCreatedPattern({
    object: { key: events.Match.wildcard('uploads/*') },
  }),
  targets: [{ arn: fn.functionArn, id: 'L1' }]
});
```

### Event Pattern Features

**Automatic Resource Injection**: Resource identifiers are automatically included in patterns

```typescript
import { BucketEvents } from '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/aws-s3/events';

declare const bucket: s3.Bucket;
const bucketEvents = BucketEvents.fromBucket(bucket);

// Bucket name is automatically injected from the bucket reference
const pattern = bucketEvents.objectCreatedPattern();
// pattern.detail.bucket.name === bucket.bucketName
```

**Event Metadata Support**: Control EventBridge pattern metadata

```typescript
import { BucketEvents } from '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/aws-s3/events';
import * as events from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-events';

declare const bucket: s3.Bucket;
const bucketEvents = BucketEvents.fromBucket(bucket);

const pattern = bucketEvents.objectCreatedPattern({
  eventMetadata: {
    region: events.Match.prefix('us-'),
    version: ['0']
  }
});
```

### Available Events

Event patterns are generated for EventBridge events available in the AWS Event Schema Registry. Common examples:

**S3 Events**:

* `objectCreatedPattern()` - Object creation events
* `objectDeletedPattern()` - Object deletion events
* `objectTagsAddedPattern()` - Object tagging events
* `awsAPICallViaCloudTrailPattern()` - CloudTrail API calls

Import events from service-specific modules:

```typescript
import { BucketEvents } from '@aws-cdk/mixins-preview/aws-s3/events';
```
