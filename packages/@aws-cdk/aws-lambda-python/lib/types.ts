   * bundling. This means that any change in the output will cause the asset to
   * be invalidated and uploaded. Bear in mind that `pip` adds timestamps to
   * dependencies it installs, which implies that in this mode Python bundles
   * will _always_ get rebuild and uploaded. Normally this is an anti-pattern
