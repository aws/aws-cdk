A CloudFront construct - for setting up the AWS CDN with ease!

Example usage:

```ts
const sourceBucket = new Bucket(this, 'Bucket');

const distribution = new CloudFrontWebDistribution(this, 'MyDistribution', {
    originConfigs: [
        {
            s3OriginSource: {
                s3BucketSource: sourceBucket
            },
            behaviors : [ {isDefaultBehavior: true}]
        }
    ]
 });
```

### Viewer certificate

By default, CloudFront Web Distributions will answer HTTPS requests with CloudFront's default certificate, only containing the distribution `domainName` (e.g. d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net).
You can customize the viewer certificate property to provide a custom certificate and/or list of domain name aliases to fit your needs.

See [Using Alternate Domain Names and HTTPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-alternate-domain-names.html) in the CloudFront User Guide.

#### Default certificate

You can customize the default certificate aliases. This is intended to be used in combination with CNAME records in your DNS zone.

Example:

[create a distrubution with an default certificiate example](test/example.default-cert-alias.lit.ts)

#### ACM certificate

You can change the default certificate by one stored Amazon Certificate Manager, or ACM.
Those certificate can either be generated by AWS, or purchased by another CA imported into ACM.

For more information, see [the aws-certificatemanager module documentation](/FIXME/LINK) or [Importing Certificates into AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html) in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.

Example:

[create a distrubution with an acm certificate example](test/example.acm-cert-alias.lit.ts)

#### IAM certificate

You can also import a certificate into the IAM certificate store.

See [Importing an SSL/TLS Certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-and-https-procedures.html#cnames-and-https-uploading-certificates) in the CloudFront User Guide.
