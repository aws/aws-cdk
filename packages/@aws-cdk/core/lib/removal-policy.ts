/**
 * Possible values for a resource's Removal Policy
 *
 * The removal policy controls what happens to the resource if it stops being
 * managed by CloudFormation. This can happen in one of three situations:
 *
 * - The resource is removed from the template, so CloudFormation stops managing it;
 * - A change to the resource is made that requires it to be replaced, so CloudFormation stops
 *   managing it;
 * - The stack is deleted, so CloudFormation stops managing all resources in it.
 *
 * The Removal Policy applies to all above cases.
 *
 * Many stateful resources in the AWS Construct Library will accept a
 * `removalPolicy` as a property, typically defaulting it to `RETAIN`.
 *
 * If the AWS Construct Library resource does not accept a `removalPolicy`
 * argument, you can always configure it by using the escape hatch mechanism,
 * as shown in the following example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const cfnBucket = bucket.node.findChild('Resource') as cdk.CfnResource;
 * cfnBucket.applyRemovalPolicy(cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY);
 * ```
