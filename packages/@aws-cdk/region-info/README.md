## Usage
Some information used in CDK Applications differs from one AWS region to
another, such as service principals used in IAM policies, S3 static website
endpoints, ...

### The `RegionInfo` class
The library offers a simple interface to obtain region specific information in
the form of the `RegionInfo` class. This is the preferred way to interact with
the regional information database:

```ts
import { RegionInfo } from '@aws-cdk/region-info';

// Get the information for "eu-west-1":
const region = RegionInfo.get('eu-west-1');

// Access attributes:
region.s3StaticWebsiteEndpoint; // s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
region.servicePrincipal('logs.amazonaws.com'); // logs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
```

The `RegionInfo` layer is built on top of the Low-Level API, which is described
below and can be used to register additional data, including user-defined facts
that are not available through the `RegionInfo` interface.

### Low-Level API
This library offers a primitive database of such information so that CDK
constructs can easily access regional information. The `FactName` class provides
a list of known fact names, which can then be used with the `RegionInfo` to
retrieve a particular value:

```ts
import regionInfo = require('@aws-cdk/region-info');

const codeDeployPrincipal = regionInfo.Fact.find('us-east-1', regionInfo.FactName.servicePrincipal('codedeploy.amazonaws.com'));
// => codedeploy.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

const staticWebsite = regionInfo.Fact.find('ap-northeast-1', regionInfo.FactName.S3_STATIC_WEBSITE_ENDPOINT);
// => s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
```

## Supplying new or missing information
As new regions are released, it might happen that a particular fact you need is
missing from the library. In such cases, the `Fact.register` method can be used
to inject FactName into the database:

```ts
regionInfo.Fact.register({
  region: 'bermuda-triangle-1',
  name: regionInfo.FactName.servicePrincipal('s3.amazonaws.com'),
  value: 's3-website.bermuda-triangle-1.nowhere.com',
});
```

## Overriding incorrect information
In the event information provided by the library is incorrect, it can be
overridden using the same `Fact.register` method demonstrated above, simply
adding an extra boolean argument:

```ts
regionInfo.Fact.register({
  region: 'us-east-1',
  name: regionInfo.FactName.servicePrincipal('service.amazonaws.com'),
  value: 'the-correct-principal.amazonaws.com',
}, true /* Allow overriding information */);
```

If you happen to have stumbled upon incorrect data built into this library, it
is always a good idea to report your findings in a [GitHub issue], so we can fix
it for everyone else!
