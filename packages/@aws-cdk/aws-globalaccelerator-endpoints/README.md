This library contains integration classes to reference endpoints in AWS
Global Accelerator. Instances of these classes should be passed to the
`endpointGroup.addEndpoint()` method.

See the README of the `@aws-cdk/aws-globalaccelerator` library for more information on
AWS Global Accelerator, and examples of all the integration classes available in
this module.
