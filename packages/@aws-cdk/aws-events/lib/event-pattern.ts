/**
 * Events in Amazon CloudWatch Events are represented as JSON objects. For more
 * information about JSON objects, see RFC 7159.
 *
 * Rules use event patterns to select events and route them to targets. A
 * pattern either matches an event or it doesn't. Event patterns are represented
 * as JSON objects with a structure that is similar to that of events, for
 * example:
 *
 * It is important to remember the following about event pattern matching:
 *
 * - For a pattern to match an event, the event must contain all the field names
 *   listed in the pattern. The field names must appear in the event with the
 *   same nesting structure.
 *
 * - Other fields of the event not mentioned in the pattern are ignored;
 *   effectively, there is a ``"*": "*"`` wildcard for fields not mentioned.
 *
 * - The matching is exact (character-by-character), without case-folding or any
 *   other string normalization.
 *
 * - The values being matched follow JSON rules: Strings enclosed in quotes,
 *   numbers, and the unquoted keywords true, false, and null.
 *
 * - Number matching is at the string representation level. For example, 300,
 *   300.0, and 3.0e2 are not considered equal.
 *
 * @see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CloudWatchEventsandEventPatterns.html
