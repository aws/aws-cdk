This package provides constructs for creating Kinesis Analytics Flink
applications. To learn more about using using managed Flink applications, see
the [AWS developer
guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/java/what-is.html).

## Creating Flink Applications

To create a new Flink application, use the `Application` construct:

[simple flink application](test/integ.application.lit.ts)

The `code` property can use `fromAsset` as shown above to reference a local jar
file in s3 or `fromBucket` to reference a file in s3.

[flink application using code from bucket](test/integ.application-code-from-bucket.lit.ts)

The `propertyGroups` property provides a way of passing arbitrary runtime
properties to your Flink application. You can use the
aws-kinesisanalytics-runtime library to [retrieve these
properties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/java/how-properties.html#how-properties-access).

```ts
import * as flink from '@aws-cdk/aws-kinesisanalytics-flink';

const flinkApp = new flink.Application(this, 'Application', {
  // ...
  propertyGroups: {
    FlinkApplicationProperties: {
      inputStreamName: 'my-input-kinesis-stream',
      outputStreamName: 'my-output-kinesis-stream',
    },
  },
});
```

Flink applications also have specific configuration for passing parameters
when the Flink job starts. These include parameters for checkpointing,
snapshotting, monitoring, and parallelism.

```ts
import * as logs from '@aws-cdk/aws-logs';

const flinkApp = new flink.Application(this, 'Application', {
  code: flink.ApplicationCode.fromBucket(bucket, 'my-app.jar'),
  runtime: file.Runtime.FLINK_1_11,
  checkpointingEnabled: true, // default is true
  checkpointInterval: cdk.Duration.seconds(30), // default is 1 minute
  minPausesBetweenCheckpoints: cdk.Duration.seconds(10), // default is 5 seconds
  logLevel: flink.LogLevel.ERROR, // default is INFO
  metricsLevel: flink.MetricsLevel.PARALLELISM, // default is APPLICATION
  autoScalingEnabled: false, // default is true
  parallelism: 32, // default is 1
  parallelismPerKpu: 2, // default is 1
  snapshotsEnabled: false, // default is true
  logGroup: new logs.LogGroup(this, 'LogGroup'), // by default, a new LogGroup will be created
});
```
