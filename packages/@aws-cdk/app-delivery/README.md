## Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery for CDK Applications
This library includes a *CodePipeline* action for deploying AWS CDK Applications.

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk) project.

### Limitations
The construct library in it's current form has the following limitations:
1. It can only deploy stacks that are hosted in the same AWS account and region as the *CodePipeline* is.
2. Stacks that make use of `Asset`s cannot be deployed successfully.

### Getting Started
In order to add the `PipelineDeployStackAction` to your *CodePipeline*, you need to have a *CodePipeline* artifact that
contains the result of invoking `cdk synth -o <dir>` on your *CDK App*. You can for example achieve this using a
*CodeBuild* project.

The example below defines a *CDK App* that contains 3 stacks:
* `CodePipelineStack` manages the *CodePipeline* resources, and self-updates before deploying any other stack
* `ServiceStackA` and `ServiceStackB` are service infrastructure stacks, and need to be deployed in this order

#### `index.ts`
```ts
import codebuild = require('@aws-cdk/aws-codebuild');
import codepipeline = require('@aws-cdk/aws-codepipeline');
import cdk = require('@aws-cdk/cdk');
import cicd = require('@aws-cdk/cicd');

const app = new cdk.App();

// We define a stack that contains the CodePipeline
const pipelineStack = new cdk.Stack(app, 'PipelineStack');
const pipeline = new codepipeline.Pipeline(pipelineStack, 'CodePipeline', {
  // Mutating a CodePipeline can cause the currently propagating state to be
  // "lost". Ensure we re-run the latest change through the pipeline after it's
  // been mutated so we're sure the latest state is fully deployed through.
  restartExecutionOnUpdate: true,
  /* ... */
});
// Configure the CodePipeline source - where your CDK App's source code is hosted
const source = new codepipeline.GitHubSourceAction(pipelineStack, 'GitHub', {
  stage: pipeline.addStage('source'),
  /* ... */
});
const project = new codebuild.PipelineProject(pipelineStack, 'CodeBuild', {
  /* ... */
});
const synthesizedApp = project.outputArtifact;

// Optionally, self-update the pipeline stack
const selfUpdateStage = pipeline.addStage('SelfUpdate');
new cicd.PipelineDeployStackAction(pipelineStack, 'SelfUpdatePipeline', {
  stage: selfUpdateStage,
  stack: pipelineStack,
  inputArtifact: synthesizedApp,
});

// Now add our service stacks
const deployStage = pipeline.addStage('Deploy');
const serviceStackA = new MyServiceStackA(app, 'ServiceStackA', { /* ... */ });
const serviceStackB = new MyServiceStackB(app, 'ServiceStackB', { /* ... */ });
// Add actions to deploy the stacks in the deploy stage:
new cicd.PipelineDeployStackAction(pipelineStack, 'DeployServiceStackA', {
  stage: deployStage,
  stack: serviceStackA,
  inputArtifact: synthesizedApp,
});
new cicd.PipelineDeployStackAction(pipelineStack, 'DeployServiceStackB', {
  stage: deployStage,
  stack: serviceStackB,
  inputArtifact: synthesizedApp,
  createChangeSetRunOrder: 998,
});
```

#### `buildspec.yml`
The `PipelineDeployStackAction` expects it's `inputArtifact` to contain the result of synthesizing a CDK App using the
`cdk synth -o <directory>` command.

For example, a *TypeScript* or *Javascript* CDK App can add the following `buildspec.yml` at the root of the repository
configured in the `Source` stage:

```yml
version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    commands:
      # Installs the npm dependencies as defined by the `package.json` file
      # present in the root directory of the package
      # (`cdk init app --language=typescript` would have created one for you)
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      # Builds the CDK App so it can be synthesized
      - npm run build
      # Synthesizes the CDK App and puts the resulting artifacts into `dist`
      - npm run cdk synth -- -o dist
artifacts:
  # The output artifact is all the files in the `dist` directory
  base-directory: dist
  files: '**/*'
```
