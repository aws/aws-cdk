This library contains helpers for writing unit tests and integration tests for CDK libraries

### Unit tests

Write your unit tests like this:

```ts
const stack = new Stack();

new MyConstruct(stack, 'MyConstruct', {
    ...
});

expect(stack).to(someExpectation(...));
```

Here are the expectations you can use:

### Verify (parts of) a template

Check that the synthesized stack template looks like the given template, or is a superset of it. These functions match logical IDs and all properties of a resource.

```ts
matchTemplate(template, matchStyle)
exactlyMatchTemplate(template)
beASupersetOfTemplate(template)
```

Example:

```ts
expect(stack).to(beASupersetOfTemplate({
    Resources: {
        HostedZone674DD2B7: {
            Type: "AWS::Route53::HostedZone",
            Properties: {
                Name: "test.private.",
                VPCs: [{
                    VPCId: { Ref: 'VPC06C5F037' },
                    VPCRegion: { Ref: 'AWS::Region' }
                }]
            }
        }
    }
}));
```


### Check existence of a resource

If you only care that a resource of a particular type exists (regardless of its logical identifier), and that *some* of its properties are set to specific values:

```ts
haveResource(type, subsetOfProperties)
```

Example:

```ts
expect(stack).to(haveResource('AWS::CertificateManager::Certificate', {
    DomainName: 'test.example.com'
    // Note: some properties omitted here
}));
```
