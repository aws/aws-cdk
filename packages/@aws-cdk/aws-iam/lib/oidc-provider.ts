   * thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates.
   *
   * The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of
   * the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider
   * makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string.

   * provider. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.example.com
   * and the provider stores its keys at
   * https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the
   * thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the
   * certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.
   *
   * @default - If no thumbprints are specified (an empty array or `undefined`),
   * the thumbprint of the root certificate authority will be obtained from the
   * provider's server as described in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc_verify-thumbprint.html
