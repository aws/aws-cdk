/**
 * Regression guard for https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/37996.
 *
 * Consumers who enable TypeScript's `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` can't pass a
 * concrete construct where its interface is expected, and type-checking
 * `aws-cdk-lib` fails for them outright — because a class member typed
 * `T | undefined` is not assignable to an interface's optional `?: T`. The
 * library doesn't build with the flag, so these breaks slip past its own compile
 * and only surface downstream.
 *
 * The shared harness compiles this snippet with the flag on; the assertion is
 * that this package's concrete classes stay assignable to their interfaces.
