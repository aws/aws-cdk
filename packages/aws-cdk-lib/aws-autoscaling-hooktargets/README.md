# Lifecycle Hook for the CDK AWS AutoScaling Library


This library contains integration classes for AutoScaling lifecycle hooks.
Instances of these classes should be passed to the
`autoScalingGroup.addLifecycleHook()` method.

Lifecycle hooks can be activated in one of the following ways:

* Invoke a Lambda function
* Publish to an SNS topic
* Send to an SQS queue

For more information on using this library, see the README of the
`aws-cdk-lib/aws-autoscaling` library.

For more information about lifecycle hooks, see
[Amazon EC2 AutoScaling Lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
