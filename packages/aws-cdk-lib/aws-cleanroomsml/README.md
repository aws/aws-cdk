There are no official hand-written ([L2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_lib)) constructs for this service yet. Here are some suggestions on how to proceed:

- Search [Construct Hub for CleanRoomsML construct libraries](https://constructs.dev/search?q=cleanroomsml)
- Use the automatically generated [L1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_l1_using) constructs, in the same way you would use [the CloudFormation AWS::CleanRoomsML resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_CleanRoomsML.html) directly.

However, you can still use the automatically generated [L1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_l1_using) constructs, and use this service exactly as you would using CloudFormation directly.

For more information on the resources and properties available for this service, see the [CloudFormation documentation for AWS::CleanRoomsML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_CleanRoomsML.html).
