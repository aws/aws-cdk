This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

```ts nofixture
import * as bedrockagentcore from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-bedrockagentcore';
```

L2 constructs for this service are available in the [`@aws-cdk/aws-bedrock-agentcore-alpha`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-cdk/aws-bedrock-agentcore-alpha) package.

You can also use the automatically generated [L1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_l1_using) constructs, in the same way you would use [the CloudFormation AWS::BedrockAgentCore resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_BedrockAgentCore.html) directly.
