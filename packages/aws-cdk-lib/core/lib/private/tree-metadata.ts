 *
 * To write the tree, we will do the following:
 *
 * - Iterate through the tree in a breadth-first manner, building the serializable version
 *   of the tree as we go.
 * - Once we get to a threshold of N nodes, when we try to add a new child node to the tree
 *   we will convert the prospective parent to the root of a new tree and replace it
 *   with a reference in the original tree.
 *   - Choosing this method instead of making the child a new root because we have to
 *     assume that all leaf nodes of a "full" tree will still get children added to them,
 *     and there will be C=(avg outdegree)^(tree depth) of them. Converting the existing
 *     leaves in-place to a different node type will (probably) minimally change
 *     the size of the tree, whereas adding C more children that will all become
 *     references to substrees will add an unpredictable size to the tree.
 *
 * Here's a sense of the numbers: a project with 277k nodes leads to an 136M JSON
 * file (490 bytes/node). We'll estimate the size of a node to be 1000 bytes.
