   * Use this method instead of `instanceof` to properly detect `TreeCloudArtifact`
   * instances, even when the construct library is symlinked.
   *
   * Explanation: in JavaScript, multiple copies of the `cx-api` library on
   * disk are seen as independent, completely different libraries. As a
   * consequence, the class `TreeCloudArtifact` in each copy of the `cx-api` library
   * is seen as a different class, and an instance of one class will not test as
   * `instanceof` the other class. `npm install` will not create installations
   * like this, but users may manually symlink construct libraries together or
   * use a monorepo tool: in those cases, multiple copies of the `cx-api`
   * library can be accidentally installed, and `instanceof` will behave
   * unpredictably. It is safest to avoid using `instanceof`, and using
   * this type-testing method instead.
