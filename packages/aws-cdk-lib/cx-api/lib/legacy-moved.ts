// Copy/paste of some types we use in the public API of `aws-cdk-lib`.
//
// jsii has a limitation/bug, in that:
//
// - it will correctly consider types *exported* here as seeming to originate
//   from the current jsii assembly; BUT
// - types *used* in the current assembly will be resolved all the way to their
//   source definition, which in this case is not a jsii assembly.
//
// So the types used in `aws-cdk-lib` must have their definition site here,
// and the only way to get that correct is:
//
// - For types: declaring them here and using TS to assert that the types are equivalent.
// - For classes: declaring them here and using runtime JS trickery to use the
//   underlying class type.
//
// This is an indication of a missing jsii feature, that we might or might not build.
// For now, this'll do (pig).
