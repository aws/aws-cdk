> The APIs of higher level constructs in this module are in **developer preview** before they become stable. We will only make breaking changes to address unforeseen API issues. Therefore, these APIs are not subject to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and breaking changes will be announced in release notes. This means that while you may use them, you may need to update your source code when upgrading to a newer version of this package.

Migrate TypeScript `import` statements from modular CDK (i.e. `@aws-cdk/aws-s3`) to mono-cdk (i.e. `monocdk-experiment/aws-s3`);

Usage:

```shell
$ rewrite-imports lib/**/*.ts
```

NOTE: `node_modules` and `*.d.ts` files are ignored.
